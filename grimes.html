[dZottLpzIxc].mp3. The tour was really fun. We had a really good crew this time.
The opening act, Nicole Dallenganger, is great. Her friends are great. Crowds
are good. Nice thing about my new song is I got to finish writing lyrics so
people were able to sing along, which is not always easy with my older material.
I think I'm taking visiting dogs off because, I don't know, sometimes I feel
like animals get stressed at the show. I thought it would be a nice thing, but
there's been a couple times where I'm like, I really feel like this animal is
really stressed out and shouldn't be here, so no more visiting dogs. I think we
replaced the kombucha with mate. It's not that compelling. There's no candy
allowed in the dressing room because otherwise I only eat candy. I think it's
really important to have real cups, trying to reduce garbage. I think touring is
really bad for the environment. It's one of the reasons it really stresses me
out to tour because just cartridge and shipping stuff around and flying 11
people around the world is quite a carbon footprint associated with that. So
we're just trying to reduce as much as possible. I think I probably have a bit
less production than most artists where I'm at, but I do think it's a
responsible way to go. When I travel and when I tour, I don't bring a lot of
stuff, but a reusable water bottle for airplanes, and I have this weird little
stuff guy. I bring one of those just so you have something to hug when you
sleep. Oh, and books. I always bring books. Yeah, it's pretty simple.",365

yes. I think I would. I have a huge aesthetic fascination with everything that
is in Earth. Something that I don't understand and I like that I can understand
it. And it just seems that they, I don't know, know something that I don't know.
And I want to make music that sounds like it's made from like, the point of view
of just some like, not extraterrestrial, but like otherworldly kind of like,
choir that's like, power, or not power, like just knows something that like,
other people don't know. It's this like incredible, like solitary, like infinite
thing, blackness, that you could like, float through forever. You know, it would
be like being in the biggest like, cathedral ever. Like I imagine like being in
this like, you know, like this like, immense reverb that is just like, you know,
you sing out into space and it's like, but you know, I, assuming that it's a
vacuum, I don't, I guess that wouldn't happen. I love like just thinking, I
don't know, it's a, it's pretty, I guess dorky or whatever, but like, I really
firmly believe that there is alien life out there. I firmly believe that the
universe is infinite. I think the sound of like longing in music is like really
beautiful. And I, I, I, I, I don't know, a lot of my music has this like
wishful, like, sort of like longing sense to it, I think, because it's like, so
trying to like get somewhere that I can like not, that I can't go. Please don't
let us pass, please don't let us pass. I feel a lot of the time that I'm like, I
can't really like express myself to other people. So like when I am like making
music or doing like visual art, like that is like really, like it's such an
abstract way to like express how you feel. But I really feel like that is so
much more me than how I am in everyday life. Ultimately, I feel like I am an
extremely lonely person, I don't really connect with anybody at all.",487 2,"ood
Diamonds interview [1lSxzjm7RB4].mp3. Hello everyone and welcome to a very, very
exciting special edition of The Wedge. Why is it special? Three reasons. Number
one, I'm getting my nails did by Pinky's. I'm getting my nails did for the very
first time. Number two, I am at an historic, historic Fort York festival that is
being traveled to by train. Number three, we have a special guest. Grimes is in
the house. Grimes, thank you for joining us on The Wedge. Thanks for having me.
We're stoked to have you. We're going to be playing lots of music, lots of your
music. Talking about some bands. Do you get your nails done a lot? No, I just
started because I'm trying to quit biting them. Does this help? I think so,
yeah. Oh my gosh, this is going to help me too because I don't want to bite my
nails anymore either. Well, it's poison so if you bite it, it's going to give
you cancer. All right, so we're going to rethink getting our nails did right now
on The Wedge and you are going to check out some Grimes. See you in a minute.
After this, we get our nails did with Grimes. Hi, what do I say? That's good.
Okay. That's good. See you on The Wedge. Hello, everyone. Welcome back to The
Wedge. We are still here at Fort York, still getting our nails done up, still
here with our new good friend Grimes. So we're getting our nails done. We're
getting ready for the show. Is this your like pre-show prep? Do you like to
pamper yourself before you go on? No, this is the first time this has happened.
Really? Yeah. Well, get ready. This is it from now on. You're going to get
spoiled. You're going to have a manicurist on tour with you, a hairdresser on
tour with you. Possibly, I doubt it. Trust me, I see how it goes. I'm saying
that now. You're going to get used to this pampered lifestyle. So it's been like
an insane year for you, right? Yeah.",476 3,"I've been watching and as someone
who really enjoyed your record, I'm really stoked that you've been doing it
because you seem to be someone that kind of comes from like a really awesome,
pure punk rock place. Is that a good way of putting it? Yeah. Well, I mean, I
definitely always went to punk and ska shows when I was a kid and even in
Montreal, I mean, it's, you know, most people, it's kind of like a pop music
scene, but I feel like it's very DIY still. Yeah. Like it really seems like
there's like a, you know, like a real DIY energy to it and like sort of an
application of sort of like punk ethos to like, yeah, more poppy music type
thing. Is that something you cognate? You were like really excited to get
involved with Montreal? Because that's something that is really unique to
Montreal that you have that, I think, in other scenes other than just sort of
like the punk hardcore scene, you have a really strong DIY scene. And now I
guess hip hop too, there's a big DIY movement too. But, I mean, yeah, I mean,
one of the main reasons I moved to Montreal is because a bunch of my friends had
been there the year before me and were like, it's really cool. And they were
opening a venue and stuff. Do you think you could have done like what you've
done in Vancouver? Definitely not. Like not to diss Vancouver. I mean,
Vancouver's great, but it's super expensive. Montreal's very cheap. And, you
know, just because of that, there's also this huge scene there. And I definitely
require my, you know, my social engagement with the scene is, I'm dependent on
that. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. So is that something you want to do going
forward? Would you like to do more collaborative projects? I don't really
collaborate, but I'm definitely super into, I mean, on non-musical stuff for
sure. Like I always try as much as possible to work with people who are in the
scene for merch or, you know, anything to do with my physical appearance or
whatever. You know, support. And like, yeah, tour as much as possible with the
bands from the scene and stuff.",475 4,"So is like aesthetics, like, you know,
cause that's like, that is something that I think a lot of people, when it comes
to music, really underestimate. Like it's amazing like how many times you see
people give you a demo after a show and it's just like a really badly drawn or
photographed thing that's not well put together. There's no thought other than
just what's on the disc itself. But like the aesthetics is important. I mean, it
depends what your values are. I just really like everything to be as decorated
as possible. So. Maximist aesthetic. Minimalism. I mean, I love minimalism, but,
you know, I just, I just like, I couldn't not have a visual, a strong visual
part of the project. I definitely feel the same way. I like, you know, I'm
definitely that sort of that same mind because is it, is it something where you
think, is there like a way to escape when the music stuff gets too ridiculous
for you into the visual side of things? Yeah, that's a big part of it for me is
I can't just consistently work on music. It's nice to be able to be like, still
feel like I'm being productive, but I'm working on an album cover, working on a
video or something. And it's also a lot of the non-musical aspects are very
social for me, whereas the musical aspect is very solitary. So it's kind of
nice. It gives me an excuse to do something artistic that's not just alone in my
room. Well, speaking of a collaborative project, we're going to check a crystal
ball right now. Any collaborative memories of this collaborative project? Yeah.
Claire to elaborate, collaborate. I did a, this is from an EP I did with Dion
and when we were filming this, it was like way below freezing. It was negative
40 or something and everyone was dying and he went to pee and fell through the
ice and he was just being a total diva about it. He's like, I'm done, I'm done.
And he stormed off and then we got him to come back. I think you fall through
ice when it's freezing. That's not really a diva moment. That's like a self
preservationist moment. Yeah, but he's waving his finger like this. Collaborate
with Grimes. No mercy. They're going to beat that out.",500 5,"We'll be back on
the wedge after crystal ball and some more videos. Come back after this. Grimes
and I are going to talk LSD, but not that kind. The other kind. I got my toes
done up and my fingernails will be matching. No, I promise you won't have to
touch my toes. Welcome back to the wedge everyone. I'm Damien. I'm here with
Grimes and we are getting our nails did by Pinkies. I'm having an amazing time.
Yeah, me too. Thank you so much for inviting me to do this. Yeah, well thanks
for doing it. Alright, so I want to talk to you a little bit about LSD. No much
music. Not the drug. The band. The band. Collaborative project you started in
San Francisco I guess. LA. LA. Okay, okay. So what's the deal behind this
project? You, Crayshon. It's me, Crayshon, this rapper named Lady Tragic and my
friend Blood Diamonds who is supporting me on this tour actually. Oh, awesome,
awesome. So like, and how did this project kind of come together? Because the
song, the video, it reputed to come together in ten minutes? Pretty much. Well,
basically Crayshon and Tragic just came over to hang out and I was just, you
know, I was like, I want to work on beats. I want to work on beats. And everyone
was like, let's just make a song. And I just made this beat and then everyone
did a one-off rap take and then I just quickly produced the whole thing. Oh
yeah, because we were talking about La Tigra or something. Oh yeah. There needs
to be like a, you know, rock band, a girl rock band. Although Mike did a verse
too. But yeah, I don't know, we just pulled it together and the next day we were
hanging out and we were like, man, it would be really funny if we shot a music
video for this. And so we just shot a music video at Freak City which is a
really cool warehouse kind of place. So Crayshon, recently Riff Raff said she
was going to sell over a million records first week. What do you think? 10
million? Maybe. I've actually heard some of her record and it's pretty cool. I
think it's going to be really exciting.",500 6,"I'm really excited about it.
Yeah, yeah, me too. As someone who kind of came out of punk, like I don't know
if you see the same thing, but like kind of looking at right now what's
happening in hip hop, it really feels like, not that it's like a punk rock thing
because it's totally different, but there's like, it's almost like the DIY ethos
where the means of production are in the hands of the artists and stuff. Yeah,
like Space Ghost Purp produced his record. I don't know, I've just been noticing
a lot of really cool stuff happening in rap and stuff lately, like, you know,
Azalea Banks and stuff. The backing tracks, like the backing stuff is really
crazy. And it's also kind of like artists are able to like, you know, establish
themselves without any industry. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. All right, so we're going
to check out the song that started all for Crayshon, Gucci Gucci. I like this
song when it came out. Yeah, yeah, me too. All right, so we're going to check
out some Gucci Gucci. We're going to secretly dance and not tell anyone because,
you know, we're waiting for a new record to come out and we're not really that
into the old stuff anymore. Now we're going to dance for real, though. No, I'm
just kidding. We don't have to dance for real. It's just for TV. I would. OK,
we're going to dance for real. We're going to dance for real. We'll be back on
the wedge. So in all the ways I've failed my son in the first three years of his
life, today I'm going to blow his mind when I come home with a disco ball
finger. That's right, Holden. This is for you. We'll be back on the wedge with
more grimes. Welcome back to the wedge, everyone, where grimes myself are
getting our nails done. I are now joined by a very, very special guest, Mr.
Blood Diamond. Hello. You are on tour right now. How are you having fun on this
big tour? It's great. It's like summer camp. I bet. Yeah, I love it.",475
7,"What's the train like? I haven't been on the train yet, but we just blew up
some condoms with water and it didn't work out. All right. So Blood Diamond is
one of your favorite artists, you were saying. He's gone on tour with you,
opening up these dates and stuff. Yeah, we were just roommates. He's on the LSD
thing, too. Oh, we're just talking some LSD. Yeah, I say pap smear. Pap smear.
What did pat smear, though, from the germs? Yes. Good reference. It was good.
Found it. All right. So what are some of the other new artists you're feeling
right now? Blood Orange. You like just blood. Yeah, it's a good word. There will
be blood. That's a good movie. Good movie. True Blood. A great show. Really? A
great show? I love it. I don't like the fairyland stuff. I kind of like it.
Really? That's the one that loses me. I love when it's kind of real and the
verisimilitude of the vampire stuff and then the fairyland. Well, the vampires
are the best part. True. All right. So what are some of the other new artists
you're feeling right now? Definitely loving Doldrums. We just finished a tour
with them in Europe. It's one guy, Eric, but he's amazing. And is there Mac
DeMarco? Yeah, Mac DeMarco is the best. Great videos. All right. Well, we're
going to check out some Mac DeMarco right now. What videos? Is there any video
in particular you'd like to see? I really love Exercising With My Demons. Well,
we, I think, have that all lined up for you to play right now. So we're going to
check out Mac DeMarco, Grimes, one of the new artists that you wanted to check
out. And we're going to continue getting our nails done. We'll be back on the
Wedge after this. Is it just me or are you getting high off the fumes? Maybe a
little bit. We'll be back getting high off the nail fumes on the Wedge. Welcome
back to the Wedge, everyone. Well, this is the time in the show that I hate the
most.",485 8,"he Concept of Genre and New Album ‘Miss Anthropocene’ ｜ AUDIO
ONLY [rt8GL6rfs g].mp3. You're listening to SiriusXM, you. I'm Julia Cunningham.
We are beyond thrilled to have Grimes in our SiriusXM studios. Grimes, welcome.
Thanks so much for having me. We love having you. Well, the last time you were
here, you were like with Alexis Krauss. You were with all these other people.
Took over, offered up music for an entire week. But it's nice to have you sort
of back as an entity, as Grimes releasing music in 2019. Yeah. You were not away
for a long time. I mean, you were continuously active in releasing music and
popping up on other songs over the last few years. But it felt like we've we're
not at like Chinese Democracy or Dear Tommy, where it's like, where's this
album? And yet we're close. We're close. We're close. But yes. No. Yeah. It has
a release date. Thank God. Really? Can we reveal the release date? Not yet.
We're checking with suits. Well, he's not he's emphatically not in a suit. He's
not in a suit. He's in a kimono. He's in a kimono with like a beautiful hat. You
know, something I think a Bob Weir representing every decade from the last like
10 or so. Yeah. But so basically a date is coming is what you're telling me. It
will be out. So can because this will air Friday morning. So can we say I
actually don't know the date, but it does exist. It does. After all this, I
don't. Twenty first. We're getting permission. Far from now. It's coming out
February twenty twenty first for Miss Anthropocene. Miss Anthropocene. Miss
Anthropocene. Miss Anthropocene. Which I now regret because I have renewed faith
in humanity. You do. Well, I wanted to sort of ask you because this is an album
that you've been working on for a while and went through a lot in the cycle of
this album, including emotions, loss, all these sort of things that shaped that
time, but that you also emerged out of and start working on other things.",479
9,"And so how do you even reflect on this album? Like, where is it with you? I
actually think this album is sick. I'm just not in the headspace anymore. But I
actually think it's probably my best, probably my best album. It's just like
it's been done for like a year kind of thing. Right. Yeah. But it's just like
I've learned my lesson from the Scrapped album last time and all the drama
ensuing from that to not throw away years worth of music. Yeah. People get
angry. And also it's like a waste of like, why would I do this work? And then
just toss it. And then toss it. But also just like a cathartic thing in a way.
Right. Because no matter what it like, it represents a moment in your life.
Yeah. And it's like fun. Now that I'm actually I've actually gone full circle
where, you know, when you finish an album, you always fucking hate it because
you're like, God, you've just been in it for so long. And I've actually it's
been now I'm kind of coming back around to it. So now this is one of the first
albums I'll be promoting while actively enjoying it. Oh, cool. Right. Yeah.
Instead of being like filled with self-hatred. Yeah. You know, it's sitting
right. It's sitting. Yeah, exactly. Well, and so then but also you have been
sort of open about like already working on things. So it's like you as an
artist, we see in our minds like you working constantly. Right. So like are
there are we on stage of like album number four already of this cycle of 2019 or
something? Or are you actually like sitting with this? Well, it's weird because
this album was actually a double album. So you're only getting one half of it.
But the other half is I cannot fixing old music is like literally. It's so much
more painful. So originally, Miss Anthropocene was a double album. But I can't.
Yeah. Like a darker side, a lighter side. I mean, there's it was all pretty
dark. It was supposed to be sort of like my melancholy and infinite sadness sort
of album. But I just can't. Like when you're fixing like. Fixing. I just want to
make new things.",492 10,"And what do you mean by fixing? Do you mean like your
own wanting to go back and just like not being able to hit like save and export
or something? It's just like constantly going back to minutia or overall things.
Well, you know, there's like a demo like a demo can be pretty scrappy and you
can be like, wow. Like I can tell when a demo is going to be a great song in the
end. But like the actual process of making a demo and to a finished song. I'm
not always like some demos are better, you know, but like typically, especially
stuff with like metal and rock and that kind of thing, which there are a lot of
the songs that are not on didn't make the cut are like more kind of, you know,
it's like guitar music done wrong just sounds like shit because it's like, yeah,
you just want to be very precise with engineering on that because otherwise it's
just like what the. Right. And you were sort of self taught with guitar within
the last yes, half half decade. The last everything. Really? Well, I haven't
played guitar. Once I finished this album, I was like, wow, I'll never touch
another goddamn guitar ever again. Really? So now I'm sure I can remember how to
play guitar. But definitely I've lost my you have you don't have the nails now,
really, for me. But, OK, we have Grimes with us. I actually think we should take
a quick break because we're just hanging right now. Grimes is with us when we
come back. Grimes is here for a specific purpose, and that is to unveil new
music, which she's been teasing via social media. And we will do that. So hang
here on Sirius XMU and we'll be back in just a few minutes. You're listening to
Sirius XMU. Good morning. I'm Julia Cunningham. We have Grimes in studio. Kindly
here to hang with us and also play new music. A track that you had been sort of
teasing was you were you were kindly responding to fans on social media about
the status of vinyl pressing, et cetera, all these sort of things, and then
revealed this week that a new song was coming today. We have that track. It's
called So Heavy I Fell Through the Earth.",485 11,"Tell us a little bit about
where this song came in the batch of Miss Anthropocene. Ah, I it sort of came
near the end when I was like reverting to synthesizer life. And yeah, no, I
don't know. I just had this like crazy dream and I just make it a song. Really?
And I wanted to make something like burial, like I like kind of like Lauren kind
of thing. It sounded almost like when the first time I heard it, it's very
layered. It's very sort of peak and valley with it. It reminded me of some of
your like earlier work. Really? Yeah. It's meant to be. Well, it's also meant to
be like movie trailer ish. Like, like, I got really obsessed with the Assassin's
Creed movie trailer for some reason. I don't even think it's a very good film,
apparently. But the movie trailer, the trailer is just excellent. And what
aspect of it was it that that inspired this sort of like layering of your voice,
just like that sort of epic sweeping sound? By the epic sweeping, do you mean
the like the. Yes. Well, that's like a. You imagine like a drone shot going over
a forest or something. Like a like a large battle or something. Yeah. I don't
know. I don't I don't. I mean, typically, I'm just sort of like following the
vibe. Yeah. I just want to make something sound like movie, like sound sick in
it. I don't know. With like a really high budget action shot. Dramatic thing.
Yeah. And you were saying this came from a dream, but then quickly like is
because in the past you've described like violence happening like almost within
an hour that it was just. Yeah. Comes out really quickly. Is that with a lot of
humor? Is that with this song specifically? No, this this one was a big, big
trial. I mean, it's it's a very you can probably hear that like when it's unless
it's fit together perfectly, it completely falls apart. It's like a very kind of
like, you know, even the bit that bass line is like not very compressed or it
just the song just is barely hanging together by thread, which you can probably
I don't know if you can tell that or not. Maybe that's just me. You'll be able
to judge.",496 12,"Can you tell that it's hanging on by just a thread of a seam?
Yeah. We're going to listen to it right now. We have Grimes here. This is brand
new music from Grimes. It's called So Heavy. I Fell Through the Earth on Sirius
XMU. You're listening to Sirius XMU. I'm Julia Cunningham. You just heard brand
new music from Grimes. So Heavy. I Fell Through the Earth, which you can find on
her new album, Misanthropocene, which is coming out in February of next year.
Must feel great to like have that weight lifted of. Oh, yeah. Great. Happening.
It's happening for people that it was just able to sort of first hear that song,
as you describe, sort of wanting to have like a much larger sort of movie
trailer feel. Everything else you've talked about, the concept of this record. I
feel sorry. Oh, no. Tell me. I feel like you should have said movie trailer. I
feel like it's just demeaning to the song. No, I don't. I mean, in a positive
way, though. Yeah. Yeah. No. But like in sort of the story, because you've
described the album as a like a concept album about this sort of like super
villain, this like goddess of climate change. Yeah. Morphic. Where's this for?
Like, is this sort of in that that character's narrative? Is this where are we
sort of in the album? Well, I've kind of gone into this crazy thing in my mind.
I've gone like way farther in my mind than I've ever said anything to anyone
else. Everyone is like, what the fuck are you talking about? But in my in my
mind, I was sort of like I was like, oh, yeah, God is a climate change. And I
started being like all the new gods, you know, like the goddess of plastic, like
the goddess of fashion, like the goddess of social media. Like I just started
being like, whoa, what would be like like we still live in a polytheistic
society, you know, like our gods would reflect the state of affairs. So we'd
have these super like techno gods and they're all probably like super young and
sick and crazy. I've sort of been imagining them as like pop stars.",485 13,"And
so I sort of like start imagining all the songs as like from the perspective of,
you know, the new gods or whatever or what sort of in this universe or whatever.
So, yeah, it's all kind of like I don't know what you're calling techno paganism
or something like. Yeah, I mean, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it makes sense. So then,
like, from what we've heard and we've heard the song Violence so far, we heard
like a demo of Pretty Dark, like it's pretty dark. Oh, no, that's just some shit
I made. Oh, my God. It's great, though. But like, what was it? Yeah. Oh, my God.
But like genre influence. Like, is there is there a thread of sound through the
album? No. Everyone's so attached to genre. In fact, OK, there is one. But
there's no real genre to grimes, but there are influences. There is a genre, in
fact, which I would I would make an argument that there is a genre. My manager's
laughing at me. New grimes. No, my man. You grime. The psychological. I'm
falling apart. Stop laughing at me. OK. OK. So the thing I've been fucking
saying is like everywhere we go, people are like, oh, sorry, like does it's not
a genre. Can't fit a format. Oh, playlist. Oh, it's too hard. Like no genre. And
I'm like, there is actually genre of a lot of artists who all have this similar
problem, like probably like Kate Bush, Bjork, FK Twigs. And everyone's like,
what's the genre? Like it. And it's like, I don't know. It's like weird sci fi
fantasy, like female auteur or just a tour. Like, I don't think it needs to be
gendered. Like typically kind of like like ARCA falls into that category. Yeah,
ARCA. You know, like hyper visual music video oriented, often involved in
directing the videos like, you know, I would probably call it like ethereal
music or something. But I feel like it's sort of this like, I don't know. I've
just been not I actually hate genres and putting things in genres.",480 14,"But
I'm also just like I feel like there's a disservice being done to a particular
type of artist because everyone always says they don't have a genre. So there is
no format to support them in the they just kind of we're just sort of stuck in
the ether like me and a bunch of my people that I feel like contemporary, a
kinship to. And I would argue that it would be time to perhaps, even though
everyone hates being boxed in, but it is we should probably like have a genre
for this kind of shit because you know, because a lot of it is sort of
post-genre and very. Yeah. At the edge of like, you know, like Kate Bush, Bjork,
Twigs, whatever. They're definitely at the edge of what the technology permits
sonically. So that that would also be like a. Oh, yeah. You know, like I'm
always trying to be like, like, what's the weirdest sounds I can get? What have
I not heard before? What can I put together that I haven't heard before? And
that's part of the reason everyone's like it's not a genre. Oh, yeah. Like I
remember Bjork always talking about how she had to wait for technology to catch
up to her idea of how to make music. Yeah. It's like falling. But there is a
when I hear it. Oh, that's a grime song. Sure. In a way. Well, I, I, I, I think
my voice is and especially with my lisp and stuff, it's like you can't really. I
can't really escape. Break in a speech impediment. Unfortunately, it makes it
easy to. But it makes it distinct. It makes it you. It makes it grime. I'm you
know, until like the like in the 1800s, having a lisp was actually considered

is. There you go. You just won an MMVA. For you almost ran away from your award.
Oh, wow. Cool. Oh, my God. So the video is epic. You not only starred in it, but
you also directed it. And I know you worked with Janelle. What was that like
working with her? Oh, really amazing. I've never worked with an actress before,
especially not one of her caliber. So it was just really I was very, very
nervous. Yeah. Nice. And EDM music right now is is blowing up. I mean, it has
been for the past couple of years. But why do you think that is? Um, I don't
know. It just sounds really good live, I think it's like it just and especially
since there's no live vocals, it can be way louder in a festival setting. So,
you know, you can just kind of slam the people and people. People love you live.
People love hearing you live. Definitely. Now you're a Canadian girl. So how

it feels it feels amazing. It's it's really cool.",501 16,"s Advice Backstage At
MMVAs [cyzr1q Y8z0].mp3. I like the idea that your fan base is legion, so loyal,

it or not. I don't know. How do you feel about what's happening right now? Oh,
no, it's really nice. I'm not against it. I just, I'm usually too weird to be
invited to these kinds of things. Isn't that the beauty? You're not, obviously.
Yeah, no, it's very kind that I was asked to come. And tied for the most
nominations. Yeah, yeah, no, it's a huge honor. It's very exciting. My
grandparents are stoked. Yeah, because they can watch it. Are they in Vancouver?
Yes, well, they're in kind of the wilderness. Out in that area? In the general
vicinity. But isn't it kind of a testament to, you know, when maybe people ask
you for advice, or young performers that might ask you for advice, is the first
thing that comes to mind, like, follow your heart, follow your gut? Because it's
gotten you where you are today? I mean, I guess. I don't know. I guess my first
advice would be something akin to, like, try to learn a bit about business and
don't mess things up. Right. You know? Because I know a lot of people who follow
their heart and then they just get wrecked by the industry. So you just have to
be prepared for the industry. Which is, you know, not a nice thing to tell young
artists, but probably that's the... Sorry, am I being too cynical? No, no, no,
no, no. I think there's a lot of really amazing Canadian artists coming up. You
know, like, I know a young female producer, songwriter called Nicole
Dallenganger in Toronto who's just, like, amazing. Like, she's got, like, six
albums or something, or seven albums. Like, it's some total Daniel Johnston,
like, savant sh**. Like I just think she's the sh**. But yeah, I mean, I think
there's a lot of really cool, like, young Canadian people coming.",479 17,e

Portlandia, Fred Armisen. Thank you so much. I love Grimes. I love her music.
She is beyond brilliant. I feel like whenever I hear her music, it is
immediately great. The first time I heard Grimes, I was like, what is this? It's
just, it makes me feel very lucky to be in this time of music. And she's a
visionary and everything that she does, and I think visually too, is just
revolutionary all the time. And it's really something that someone can make
something so deep and so amazing. I love it. I love it. It is my honor to
present the 2013's Webby Award for Artist of the Year to Grimes. This is more
than five words.",197 19,"RT ZOOM 🔍 The Fall of the Rebel Angels ｜ Google Arts
& Culture [t36rFZGH30s].mp3. This painting is such a nightmare. Like, God, it's
so horrific. Wow. This painting is called The Fall of the Rebel Angels by
Bruegel the Elder, the most significant artist of Dutch and Flemish Renaissance.
The painting dates from 1562, when the wars of religion started to intensify in
Europe. It depicts a passage from the final book of the Bible and describes the
apocalypse, the epic battle between good and evil. At the center of the
composition, there's Archangel Michael, leader of the army of God, slender with
his wings spread, shiny golden armor, and turquoise cape. St. Michael's right
foot rests on the stomach of the seven-headed dragon he just slayed and hurled
to the depths of hell. In his task, St. Michael is assisted by other angels,
turning their swords against their former companions or blowing trumpets to
cheer the troops. Around him, it's utter chaos. This is like a deeply emotional
piece. He must have been having a really bad day. The painting is divided into
two halves. The upper part, the heavens, is illuminated by a divine halo. But as
we move down to the hellish bottom, the colors get darker and more opaque. It's
a chaotic but meticulously painted mass of monstrous fallen angels. These
contrasting tones reinforce the idea of the struggle between good and evil, a
recurring theme in Bruegel's work. Bruegel added some quirky or gory details,
such as farting demons, naked creatures showing their guts or arses. I'm just
super attracted to that kind of thing. I don't really know why. I like this dog
with the crown. It's like the one pleasant thing. I feel like this is just meant
to be super gross, but the religious symbolism is obvious here. Spirit is
stronger than flesh. It does feel distinctly modern. It does sort of feel like
some of these creatures seem like they could be made in SpongeBob SquarePants.
Amongst these half-animal, half-human hybrids, there are chimeras, quite a large
number of insects and crustaceans, but also amphibians, huge mussels, a bat, and
wonders from the recently discovered New World.",481 20,"e Interview [P
PHIpYm8k0].mp3. Hey, I'm Grimes and this is my Hunger cover shoot. Well I guess
I just, I engineered a pop star, if that makes any sense. You know, I just, um,
but I used myself. But you know, I directed all the videos and did all the album
art and wrote all the songs and produced all the songs and um, I don't know, I
like created a company, a brand, which is Grimes, which is my life, I guess. I
guess maybe Lady Gaga did it first, actually, so never mind, but, but no, but
like it was DIY, you know, it was totally DIY. And it started out with me
finding tapes in the garbage and finding a tape copier in the garbage and
copying the tapes by hand, you know, so. I mean I think the key difference,
like, there's a degree of putting stuff on for Grimes. I mean there's also the
fact that Grimes is like a public thing, you know, so any situation in which I'm
engaging with like a huge audience, it's like, I can't be me completely because
it's just really nerve-wracking. And I think that's a lot of the, it's taken me
a long time to just get comfortable speaking on camera and stuff because it's
not something I was used to, you know, like this whole thing happened in like a
year, so I had to learn real quick. I think that's kind of the main difference
is that Grimes is something, just because there's so many eyes on it, it's
inherently different from just how I am. And on the other hand, I guess like
Grimes is kind of like the uncensored version from an artistic standpoint
because, you know, what I'm doing with music or something, like a lot of times
it's stuff that I don't even talk to people about or, you know, like I can't
sing in front of my friends, like I couldn't.",425 21,"I probably couldn't sing
in a room of five, like I can sing in front of 5,000 people but I could not sing
in front of five people, you know, and I think that's sort of the weird, the
weird thing about this is that on one hand it's way more real but it's only real
almost because it's so surreal to access such a huge number of people rather
than a small number of people. You know, on a personal level, it's almost
scarier to be like real with yourself, you know, who you are or whatever. Like
M.I.A. for example, like just her ability to construct her, the mythology of
M.I.A. is really good regardless of what you think about her, you know, it's,
like that's a talent on its own. There's definitely a degree to which I think if
someone is considered to be important in fashion that they can't be a techie
kind of person, you know, and I think that's a really weird, like fashion as an
industry has a reputation for being vapid or something which is another kind of
one of these things that you see. But, you know, it's like I feel like for
M.R.I. Carey or, you know, like anyone who's a sex icon, it's like there's no
way that they could be important in terms of the songwriting or production, but
it's like who could write top line for M.R.I. Carey, you know what I mean? She's
M.R.I. Carey, like no one else can sing that, so how could someone, how could
some dude possibly write that for her, you know what I mean? Or sometimes I
think a lot of people feel like sexism is over, and I didn't even really
experience a lot of sexism in my life until I really entered the music industry
and then it was like, it's difficult to buy a microphone because the guy at the
store is like laughing at me and won't take me seriously and I'm like, can I
just see your condenser mics? You know, it's that kind of thing, but I don't
know, I guess like people seem to just really assume that I'm kind of an
airhead.",460 22," REALiTi Wasn't Supposed To Be A Music Video ｜ Fuse
[ZaUr22fBdHQ].mp3. Well, I've been working with my brother for pretty much on
everything. The only thing he didn't work on was Oblivion. He worked with me a
little bit on Genesis and a lot on Go, Reality, and Flesh Without Blood. I mean,
Reality, we weren't trying to film a video. We started out doing a tour diary,
and then he was like, oh, look at this shot. Can't we just make it a music
video? And I'm like, oh, the only song I have is this song. It wasn't done at
all. And so we just shot it to the song just out of convenience. And then, yeah,
I don't know. It was kind of random. It was very improvised. We didn't have
permits for anything. We only had like a 5D. So it was a music video that wasn't
even supposed to be a music video. So I think there's kind of like this freedom
to it that was really great. But yeah, I always work with Mac. I don't even have
to tell him things. I'll be like, you know, we'll look at the light, and I'll be
like, and he'll be like, OK, I'll change it. Like, he understands exactly what,
I don't know. It saves a lot of time, and he's very skilled. For me, the DP that
I'm working with is the most important part of it, because I really have to put
a lot of trust in them, because I can't be behind the camera when I'm like, you
know, I'm like, does the shot look good? So it's super important.",376 23,"rview

you mind if I'm fun, fun, fun? I think crazy is an okay adjective. I like crazy.

my receipts, he lost all my accounting, and now he's getting grants for that
tour he lost in LA. Poor Duffy. But he's a good guy. Well, so Oblivion, the
video just came out. How's that been? How's that filming that? How's that
releasing that? Did you get a huge influx of listeners, or was it kind of
just... I don't know. I don't check the internet. I don't read my press, so I
don't know if anything's changed. My shows are getting a lot better lately. And
people know the words to the songs, and they're always dancing, and that's
really good. But, yeah, I don't know. I don't pay that much attention to it. But
the video filming was really fun. Because this is, I think it changed
everything. It's super documentarian. It looks very real. Well, it is. The thing
that's great about it, and what I'm really into is, we get emails all the time
about people that want to make treatments, but it's like, obviously my friends
are going to make a better video than some random professional.",448 24,"I know
it's a bunch of crazy shit in LA, but the fact that it was me, my best friend
Emily, and her boyfriend Evan who shot it, and he's 19, and everyone was totally
amateur, and because of that, we were all... I mean, we filmed that video for
absolutely nothing. So for everyone it was just so desperate, this has to work.
Because film is really expensive, so every minute was like $8. I don't know the
actual cost, but the whole thing cost us $2,000, which is a lot of money for us
at the time, before we paid for it. You know what I mean? We did one shot of
everything. We used almost all of it. It was just like, fuck, we have to do
this, and the camera was so heavy, we had no clue what it was going in. It was
really intense. Maybe this is a down south thing, but unfortunately football
games are a focal point of communities. How big of a deal was it to film during
a football game? Did you just go there and start filming, or did you have to
clear it out? We said we were making a student film, so we had a pass. But it
was really cool, because I've never been to a football game, and it made me like
football. Wow, you've never been to a high school game? Well, we did it on a big
thing in Canada, but it was really fun. It was really, really fun. I realized
that I love sports. Everyone was going crazy, there was always a band and all
this stuff happening. Do you have any plans for the immediate future besides

much as I do. That's true. These are the clothes we're not using. That's a lot.

you're not using, then... This is not my Gaia, but it's the same as my Gaia. But

[dkwMf0BpgSU].mp3. I never decide until like 10 minutes before I'm getting a
tattoo what it's gonna be. My god don't listen to her teens out there. As a
woman with no tattoos just consider a little more a little in advance. And what
about this so what is that one about? We were in New Zealand playing a show and
this guy was like I'll give you a free tattoo I can come to your show. So I was
like sure. Just to let these guys know we worked on my new perfume called Pop
and Grimes is one of my superstar girls. But what I really wanted to do with
this one was to represent young women in beauty in a way that you don't normally
get them to be seen so that's why I was drawn to you because you know you're not
conventional. It was pretty obvious I think yes to me because you know I really
vibe with your ethics and your thing and obviously your you know aesthetic and
everything so yeah it was pretty like a no-brainer I think. What's your
relationship with beauty and what you should look like as a young woman in music
today? Any fashion is kind of inherently political because even if you're only
wearing like a shirt and pants like that's a statement in itself because if
you're performing you know the way you look is inherently a part of it whether
you like it or not. For me I see I see it the fashion stuff is like a positive
thing I see it as a way to just enhance the project my advantage or you know
it's fun honestly. Well you don't let it control you. I mean I definitely I make
sure that I look like trash about like 20% of the time so there's never a like
reveal of me looking like trash it's like yeah commonly accepted. Yeah that goes
hand in hand. Yeah no one's ever like that's what she looks like without makeup
it's like everyone knows. Yeah no one. It's funny actually when we were doing
our work together. I shaved my armpits for that. Oh my god I'm deeply offended.
Well I'm now rebelling against my previous body hair because now people get mad
when I shave my legs so now I'm like I have the right to shave my legs. Yes
exactly.,481 27,If you talk about the wage gap and stuff it's an extra cost for
women to like wax and shave and all that it's like all this extra money and all
this extra time and you know so I think it's where the people feel obliged to do
it. Because it's funny because when we did our thing it's like afterwards it was
like oh should we retouch it or not like retouch some hair and I was like no
way. Yeah. I want to keep the hair like that is so wrong like that it goes
against everything we're trying to do. I think it's getting better. I've
definitely done some shoots recently where they didn't Photoshop my body hair. I
mean I think the fact we're having this conversation in this context it's pretty
good. So how important is it for you to stay true to yourself? Depends what
staying true is because there's also the aspect of like I'm totally down to just
like a wipe a bunch of paint all over my face but I don't I don't mean that I
just mean how important is it for you as an artist to be true to yourself and
project who you are in an honest way to your fans. A lot of it is like acting
like a lot of it the thing that's fun about it is completely being a totally
different person because I think the version like the truest version of me would
never ever probably go in public or be on camera or walk on a stage you know. So
obviously when you're making music you're you know I'm not like yeah I'm gonna
write a song about Do you ever feel like you want to act? I just I couldn't cry
I don't think so I'm probably we can work on that. I haven't I haven't worked on
it. I've been trying to like see if I can make myself cry. I think you could
muster a tear I reckon you're getting there. Maybe. Actually now I'm like
starting to cry. Let me try and make you cry. All right let's think. So the
Guardian recently said that you're the woman right now making like the best pop
music on the planet. How does that feel? I would deeply disagree. As long as
Beyonce is alive that statement is not true. How often do you come out with
stuff? I know you're pretty prolific. You've done a lot. I do a lot of songs but
not a lot of albums.,492 28,How do the two differ for you? I mean I think I see
an album as like I'm like okay this is my body of work this is when I die you
know. You approach it as a whole. Yeah whereas like you know I might sometimes
I'll work on a song with a friend I'll just drop it online if I couldn't put out
songs in between you'd be like oh my god no one's heard anything in three years.
So I think for me making the record is what I love and then the performing part
it's like I think that's what a lot of the audience really responds to. So I
kind of just try to my goal is to just make it as fun as possible. How much do
you respond to what they might give back to you? I think it's definitely an
interesting balance because on one hand you know you don't want to listen to
critics and stuff because otherwise you would probably end up making something
that is a bit more boring. But on the other hand you also want to listen to your
fans and like I probably wouldn't drop like a noise record right now you know.
Although I probably will eventually. What you do is much more sort of alone
obviously than what I do. I have a team of people we kind of get together we
talk it out we over intellectualize. That seems so fun though. I wish I had
that. I want like a team. It's good you know I feel really blessed because I get
to bounce ideas off and you know you just or you are feeding so many people with
music yet you're starting from quite a sort of you know loner point of view.
Well it's tricky too because I think a lot of times like for me when I feel
really uncomfortable with something it's it's the right thing. Like when I make
something and I'm like oh my god I'm so embarrassed by this song I can never
show this to anyone that's always you know like those are always the songs
everyone likes the most. That's like a stressful because there's kind of an
element of not trusting yourself. Like it's just a weird thing. Sometimes the
things you hate are like brilliant. Like your own voice like it's very
uncomfortable editing your own voice. Yes. It's truly disturbing like sometimes
I'm disturbed. Oh god. It is. What are you most confident in then musically?
Producing.,484 29,Like I feel very confident as a producer not a great vocalist
but see when you're a good producer you can make anything sound good. Do you
like want to produce other people too? Anyone I truly admire I'd be too
petrified to work with probably. Well that was it with Janelle I was totally
petrified. How did you guys come together? I sent her like a painting because I
was a fan. Was it like a painting of Janelle by you like really creepy? It was
like a decapitated head like nice spitting out colors. Anyway I sent her a
painting then she was just like yeah we should work on a track and then I like
had a panic attack. But then we made the track. And did she write? That's it's
one of the reasons I wanted to work with her because I really wanted to work
with a great pop vocalist but it was also really important to me that everyone
on my album including myself like that it was fully self-authored. So before we
started rolling on the camera I was like who do you want me to address you as?
Do you want to be Claire or do you want to be Grimes? You're like oh I'll be
Grimes. So what is that? What is that sort of fight between Claire and Grimes?
Well I did kill Grimes actually in that film Flesh Without Blood. Yes that was
you know. Yeah there was blood. We screwed up. I screwed up a stabbing scene so
there's no stabbing just post stabbing. Such a great video babe. Well done. I'm
actually I've now I'm now okay with Grimes again. I just you know went a little
crazy. Reincarnated? Yeah I guess maybe yeah she's reemerged. Anyway I think
you're great I've loved talking to you every step of my way. Thank you for doing
this. Thanks for letting us come here and do it here. And I'm gonna give you
some lemons to take home from my lemon tree. You can always you can always come
here for lemons even if you don't come in and shop you can just go and grab
lemons out of the back. On the security camera they'll be like late at night
someone just grabbing lemons. Anyway truly I'm a big fan of your work and I've
loved working with you. Likewise. And I want to work more with you. Yeah me
too.,495 30,ussia 2013 [R2OVGQo4830].mp3. And I play in my wallet – walking on
Ibiza Unfortunately it's my birthday this year,36 31,"t Angel (Documentary)
[fi2N5KHgO80].mp3. At first I guess there was just Grimes. I don't technically
have control of her narrative anymore. You know, she very much exists in pop
culture now. Grimes as one person cannot represent more than a couple ideas.
That's why I started developing some of the other characters. Like really
abstract from who I am or how I am. You can start being an actor and start
adding in more voices and start realizing that you don't just have to, not
everything just has to fully reflect you. The art angels are the face of it. Who
are more like superheroes, more like villains. They are the performers and I'm
the producer, writer. So much of my music is just against the people who are
trying to take it away from me. I guess overall tone is sort of like, I guess
aggressive being the word, either aggressively angry or aggressively stoked. You
have to push people and you have to become aggressive or you can't get your way.
But I'd constantly be getting emails from producers and stuff being like, I'd
love to work on some tracks on your album. It's just like, you know, that's like
me saying you guys like, hey, can I film this interview for you or can I do your
interview for you or something? It's like people just offering to do your job

to the point where I could like produce my own record and have everyone fuck off
and not like give me shit for it, you know, just let me do my fucking job. Like
why else am I here? Like I don't want to be just like the face of like this
thing that I built. I want to be the person who built it. Realizing there's no
one who's going to take control over this besides me. Like if I want this to run
smoothly and I want this to happen, then I just have to like, you know, tell
people what I want and what I need, which used to be really hard for me. I
didn't want to put something out that wasn't like a full transition into the
contemporary version of Grimes. I basically toured the world since Visions. I
learned how to perform. I learned how to sing. Just doing like a full pop show

[KOwm7GUjcg8].mp3. we are becoming cyborgs. Like our brains are fundamentally
changed. Everyone who grew up with electronics, we are fundamentally different
from previous, from homo sapiens. I call us homo techno. I think we have evolved
into homo techno, which is like essentially a new species. Previous
technologies, I mean, may have even been more profound and moved us to a certain
degree, but I think the computers are what make us homo techno. I think this is
what, it's a brain augmentation. So it like allows for actual evolution. Like
the computers accelerate the degree to which all the other technologies can also
be accelerated. Would you classify yourself as a homo sapien or a homo techno?
Definitely homo techno. So you're one of the earliest of the species. I think
most of us are. The following is a conversation with Grimes, an artist,
musician, songwriter, producer, director, and a fascinating human being who

sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Grimes. Oh yeah, the
Cloudlifter, there you go. There you go. You know your stuff. Have you ever used
a Cloudlifter? Yeah, I actually, this microphone Cloudlifter is what Michael
Jackson used, so. No, really? Yeah, this is like Thriller and stuff. This mic
and the Cloudlifter? And that, yeah, it's an incredible microphone. It's very
flattering on vocals. I've used this a lot. It's great for demo vocals. It's
great in a room. Sometimes it's easier to record vocals if you're just in a room
and the music's playing and you just wanna feel it so it's not in the
headphones. And this mic is pretty directional, so I think it's a good mic for
just vibing out and just getting a real good vocal take. Just vibing, just in a
room. Anyway, this is the Michael Jackson, Quincy Jones microphone. I feel way
more badass now. All right, let's get in. You wanna just get into it? I guess
so.",499 36,"All right, one of your names, at least in this space and time, is
C, like the letter C. And you told me that C means a lot of things. It's the
speed of light. It's the render rate of the universe. It's yes in Spanish. It's
the crescent moon. And it happens to be my favorite programming language because
it basically runs the world, but it's also powerful, fast, and it's dangerous
because you can mess things up really bad with it because of all the pointers.
But anyway, which of these associations with the name C is the coolest to you? I
mean, to me, the coolest is the speed of light, obviously. Or the speed of
light, when I say render rate of the universe, I think I mean the speed of light
because essentially that's what we're rendering at. See, I think we'll know if
we're in a simulation if the speed of light changes because if they can improve
their render speed, then. That's already pretty good. It's already pretty good,
but if it improves, then we'll know, we can probably be like, okay, they've
updated or upgraded. Well, it's fast enough for us humans because it seems
immediate. There's no delay, there's no latency in terms of us humans on Earth
interacting with things. But if you're like intergalactic species operating on a
much larger scale, then you're gonna start noticing some weird stuff. Or if you
can operate in like around a black hole, then you're gonna start to see some
render issues. You can't go faster than the speed of light, correct? So it
really limits our ability or one's ability to travel space. Theoretically, you
can, you have wormholes. So there's nothing in general relativity that precludes
faster than the speed of light to travel, but it just seems you're gonna have to
do some really funky stuff with very heavy things that have like weirdnesses,
that have basically tears in space time. We don't know how to do that. Do
navigators know how to do it? Do navigators? Yeah. Folding space, basically
making wormholes. So the name C. Yes.",455 37,"Who are you? Do you think of
yourself as multiple people? Are you one person? Do you know, like in this
morning, were you a different person than you are tonight? We are, I should say,
recording this basically at midnight, which is awesome. Yes, thank you so much.
I think I'm about eight hours late. No, you're right on time. Good morning. This
is the beginning of a new day soon. Anyway, are you the same person you were in
the morning and the evening? Is there multiple people in there? Do you think of
yourself as one person or maybe you have no clue? Or are you just a giant
mystery to yourself? Okay, these are really intense questions, but. Let's go,
let's go. Because I asked this myself, like look in the mirror, who are you?
People tell you to just be yourself, but what does that even mean? I mean, I
think my personality changes with everyone I talk to. So I have a very
inconsistent personality. Yeah. Person to person, so the interaction, your
personality materializes. Or my mood, like I'll go from being like a
megalomaniac to being like, you know, just like a total hermit who is very shy.
So some combinatorial combination of your mood and the person you're interacting
with. Yeah, mood and people I'm interacting with. But I think everyone's like
that. Maybe not. Well, not everybody acknowledges it and able to introspect it.
Who brings out, what kind of person, what kind of mood brings out the best in
you as an artist and as a human? Can you introspect this? Like my best friends,
like people who I can, when I'm like super confident and I know that they're
gonna understand everything I'm saying, so like my best friends, then when I can
start being really funny, that's always my like peak mode. But it's like, yeah,
it takes a lot to get there. Let's talk about constraints. You've talked about
constraints and limits.",426 38,"Do those help you out as an artist or as a
human being or do they get in the way? Do you like the constraints? So in
creating music, in creating art, in living life, do you like the constraints
that this world puts on you? Or do you hate them? If constraints are moving,
then you're good, right? Like it's like as we are progressing with technology,
we're changing the constraints of like artistic creation. Making video and music
and stuff is getting a lot cheaper. There's constantly new technology and new
software that's making it faster and easier. We have so much more freedom than
we had in the 70s. Like when Michael Jackson, when they recorded Thriller with
this microphone, like they had to use a mixing desk and all this stuff and like
probably even getting a studio is probably really expensive and you have to be a
really good singer and you have to know how to use like the mixing desk and
everything. And now I can just make, I've made a whole album on this computer. I
have a lot more freedom, but then I'm also constrained in different ways because
there's like literally millions more artists. It's like a much bigger playing
field. It's just like, I also, I didn't learn music. I'm not a natural musician.
So I don't know anything about actual music. I just know about like the
computer. So I'm really kind of just like messing around and like trying things
out. Well, yeah, I mean, but the nature of music is changing. So you're saying
you don't know actual music, what music is changing. Music is becoming, you've
talked about this, is becoming, it's like merging with technology. Yes. It's
becoming something more than just like the notes on a piano. It's becoming some
weird composition that requires engineering skills, programming skills, some
kind of human robot interaction skills, and still some of the same things that
Michael Jackson had, which is like a good ear for a good sense of taste of
what's good and not, the final thing, what is put together. Like you're allowed,
you're enabled, empowered with a laptop to layer stuff, to start like layering
insane amounts of stuff. And it's super easy to do that. I do think music
production is a really underrated art form. I feel like people really don't
appreciate it.",488 39,"When I look at publishing splits, the way that people
like pay producers and stuff, it's super, producers are just deeply underrated.
So many of the songs that are popular right now or for the last 20 years, part
of the reason they're popular is because the production is really interesting or
really sick or really cool. And it's like, I don't think listeners, people just
don't really understand what music production is. It's not, it's sort of like
this weird, discombobulated art form. It's not like a formal, because it's so
new, there isn't like a formal training path for it. It's mostly driven by like
autodidacts. Like it's like almost everyone I know who's good at production,
like I didn't go to music school or anything. They just taught themselves. Are
they mostly different? Like the music producers you know, is there some
commonalities that tie them together or are they all just different kinds of
weirdos? Because I just hung out with Rick Rubin. I don't know if you've- Yeah,
I mean, Rick Rubin is like literally one of the gods of music production. Like
he's one of the people who first, you know, who like made music production, you
know, made the production as important as the actual lyrics or the notes. But
the thing he does, which is interesting, I don't know if you can speak to that,
but just hanging out with him, he seems to just sit there in silence, close his
eyes and listen. It's like he almost does nothing. And that nothing somehow
gives you freedom to be the best version of yourself. So that's music production
somehow too, which is like encouraging you to do less, to simplify, to like push
towards minimalism. I mean, I guess, I mean, I work differently from Rick Rubin
because Rick Rubin produces for other artists, whereas like I mostly produce for
myself. So it's a very different situation. I also think Rick Rubin, he's in
that, I would say advanced category of producer where like you've like earned
your, you can have an engineer and stuff and people like do the stuff for you.
But I usually just like do stuff myself. So you're the engineer, the producer
and the artist. Yeah, I guess I would say I'm in the era, like the post Rick
Rubin era.",490 40,"Like I come from the kind of like Skrillex school of
thought, which is like where you are, yeah, the engineer, producer, artist. I
mean, lately, sometimes I'll work with a producer. Now I'm gently sort of
delicately starting to collaborate a bit more, but like I think I'm kind of from
the, like the whatever 2010s explosion of things where everything became
available on the computer and you kind of got this like lone wizard energy thing
going. So you embrace being the loneliness. Is the loneliness somehow an engine
of creativity? Like, so most of your stuff, most of your creative quote unquote
genius in quotes is in the privacy of your mind? Yes, well, it was, but here's
the thing. I was talking to Daniel Eck and he said, he's like most artists, they
have about 10 years, like 10 good years. And then they usually stop making their
like vital shit. And I feel like I'm sort of like nearing the end of my 10 years
on my own. And- You have to become somebody else. Now I'm like, I'm in the
process of becoming somebody else and reinventing. When I work with other
people, because I've never worked with other people, I find that I make like,
that I'm exceptionally rejuvenated and making like some of the most vital work
I've ever made. So, because I think another human brain is like one of the best
tools you can possibly find. Like- It's a funny way to put it, I love it. It's
like, if a tool is like, you know, whatever HP plus one or like adds some like
stats to your character, like another human brain will like square it instead of
just like adding something. Double up the experience points. I love this. We
should also mention we're playing tavern music before this and which I love,
which I first, I think I- You had to stop the tavern music. Yeah, because it
doesn't, the audio. Okay, okay. But it makes- Yeah, it'll make the podcast
annoying. Add it in post, add it in post. No one will want to listen to the
podcast. They probably would, but it makes me, it reminds me like of a video
game, like a role-playing video game where you have experience points.",482
41,"There's something really joyful about wandering places like Elder Scrolls,
like Skyrim, just exploring these landscapes in another world and then you get
experience points and you can work on different skills and somehow you progress
in life. And I don't know, it's simple. It doesn't have some of the messy
complexities of life. And there's usually a bad guy you can fight in Skyrim,
it's dragons and so on. I'm sure in Elden Ring, there's a bunch of monsters you
can fight. I love that. I feel like Elden Ring, I feel like this is a good
analogy to music production though, because it's like, I feel like the engineers
and the people creating these open worlds are, it's sort of like similar to
people, to music producers, whereas it's like this hidden archetype that like no
one really understands what they do and no one really knows who they are, but
they're like, it's like the artist engineer because it's like, it's both art and
fairly complex engineering. Well, you're saying they don't get enough credit.
Aren't you kind of changing that by becoming the person doing everything? Isn't
the engineer? Well, I mean, others have gone before me. I'm not, you know,
there's like Timbaland and Skrillex and there's all these people that are like,
you know, very famous for this. But I just think the general, I think people get
confused about what it is and just don't really know what it is per se. And it's
just, when I see a song, like when there's like a hit song, like I'm just trying
to think of like, just going for like even just a basic pop hit, like what's it,
like Rules by Dua Lipa or something. The production on that is actually like
really crazy. I mean, the song is also great, but it's like the production is
exceptionally memorable. Like, you know, and it's just like no one, I don't even
know who produced that song. It just like, isn't part of like the rhetoric of
how we discuss the creation of art. We just sort of like, don't consider the
music producer. Because I think the music producer used to be more just simply
recording things. Yeah, that's interesting. Cause when you think about movies,
we talk about the actor and the actresses, but we also talk about the
director.",499 42,"Directors, yeah. We don't talk about like that with the music
as often. The Beatles music producer was one of the first kind of, one of the
first people sort of introducing crazy sound design into pop music. I forget his
name. He has the same, I forget his name, but you know, like he was doing all
the weird stuff, like dropping pianos and like, yeah. Oh, to get the, yeah,
yeah, yeah. To get the sound, to get the authentic sound. What about lyrics? You
think those, where did they fit into how important they are? I was heartbroken
to learn that Elvis didn't write his songs. I was very mad. A lot of people
don't write their songs. I understand this, but. But here's the thing. I feel
like there's this desire for authenticity. I used to be like really mad when
like people wouldn't write or produce their music. And I'd be like, that's fake.
And then I realized there's all this like weird bitterness and like agroness in
art about authenticity. But I had this kind of like weird realization recently
where I started thinking that like art is sort of a decentralized collective
thing. Like art is kind of a conversation with all the artists that have ever
lived before you, you know? Like it's like, you're really just sort of, it's not
like anyone's reinventing the wheel here. Like you're kind of just taking, you
know, thousands of years of art and like running it through your own little
algorithm and then like making, you're like your interpretation of it. You just
join the conversation with all the other artists that came before. It's such a
beautiful way to look at it. Like, and it's like, I feel like everyone's always
like, there's always copyright and IP and this and that or authenticity. And
it's just like, I think we need to stop seeing this as this like egotistical
thing of like, oh, the creative genius, the lone creative genius or this or
that. Because it's like, I think art shouldn't be about that. I think art is
something that sort of brings humanity together. And it's also, art is also kind
of the collective memory of humans.",465 43,"Like we don't give a fuck about
whatever ancient Egypt, like how much grain got sent that day and sending the
records and like, you know, like who went where and how many shields needed to
be produced for this. Like we just remember their art. And it's like, you know,
it's like in our day-to-day life, there's all this stuff that seems more
important than art because it helps us function and survive. But when all this
is gone, like the only thing that's really gonna be left is the art, the
technology will be obsolete. That's so fascinating. Like the humans will be
dead. That is true. A good compression of human history is the art we've
generated across the different centuries, the different millennia. So when the
aliens come. When the aliens come, they're gonna find the hieroglyphics and the
pyramids. I mean, art could be broadly defined. They might find like the
engineering marvels, the bridges, the rockets, the- I guess I sort of classify
though. Architecture is art. Yes. I consider engineering in those formats to be
art, for sure. It sucks that like digital art is easier to delete. So if there's
an apocalypse, a nuclear war that can disappear. Yes. And the physical, there's
something still valuable about the physical manifestation of art. That's, that
sucks that like music, for example, has to be played by somebody. Yeah, I mean,
I do think we should do have a foundation type situation where we like, you know
how we have like seed banks up in the North and stuff? Yeah. Like we should
probably have like a solar powered or geothermal little bunker that like has all
the, all human knowledge. You mentioned Daniel Hayek and Spotify. What do you
think about that as an artist? What's Spotify? Is that empowering? I get to me
Spotify sort of as a consumer is super exciting. It makes it easy for me to
access music from all kinds of artists, get to explore all kinds of music, make
it super easy to sort of curate my own playlist and have fun with all that. It
was so liberating to let go. You know, I used to collect, you know, albums and
CDs and so on, like, like, like horde albums. Yeah. Like they matter.",478
44,"But the reality you can, you know, that was really liberating that I could
let go of that and letting go of the albums you're kind of collecting allows you
to find new music, exploring new artists and all that kind of stuff. But I know
from a perspective of an artist that could be, like you mentioned, competition
could be a kind of constraint because there's more and more and more artists on
the platform. I think it's better that there's more artists. I mean, again, this
might be propaganda because this is all from a conversation with Daniel Ek. So
this could easily be propaganda. Like- We're all a victim of somebody's
propaganda. So let's just accept this. But Daniel Ek was telling me that, you
know, at the, cause I, you know, when, when I met him, I like, I was, I came in
all furious about Spotify and like I grilled him super hard. So I've got his,
his answers here. But he was saying like at the sort of peak of the CD industry,
there was like 20,000 artists making millions and millions of dollars. Like
there was just like a very tiny kind of 1%. And Spotify has kind of democratized
the industry because now I think he said there's about a million artists making
a good living from Spotify. And when I heard that, I was like, honestly, I would
rather make less money and have just like a decent living than, and have more
artists be able to have that. Even though I like, I wish it could include
everyone, but- Yeah, that's really hard to argue with. YouTube is the same. Is
YouTube's mission, they want to basically have as many creators as possible and
make a living, some kind of living. Yeah. And that, that's so hard to argue
with. It's so hard. But I think there's better ways to do it. My manager, I
actually wish he was here. I like, I would have brought him up. My manager is
building an app that can manage you. So it'll like help you organize your
percentages and get your publishing and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. So you can take
out all the middlemen, so you can have a much bigger, it'll just like automate
it.",472 45,"So you can get- So automate the manager? Automate, automate,
management, publishing, like, and legal, it can read, the app he's building can
read your contract and like tell you about it. Because one of the issues with
music right now, it's not that we're not getting paid enough, but it's that the
art industry is filled with middlemen because artists are not good at business.
And, you know, from the beginning, like Frank Sinatra, it's all mob stuff. Like
it's the music industry, you know, is run by business people, not the artists.
And the artists really get very small cuts of like what they make. And so I
think part of the reason I'm a technocrat, which I mean, your fans are gonna be
technocrats, so no one's, they're not gonna be mad at me about this, but like my
fans hate it when I say this kind of thing, or the general public. They don't
like technocrats. They don't like technocrats. Like when I watched Battle Angel
Alita, and they were like the Martian technocracy, and I was like, yeah, Martian
technocracy. And then they were like, and they're evil. And I was like, ooh,
okay. I was like, cause Martian technocracy sounds sick to me. Yeah, so your
intuition as technocrats would create some kind of beautiful world. For example,
what my manager's working on, if you can create an app that removes the need for
a lawyer, and then you could have a smart contracts on the blockchain, removes
the need for like management and organizing all this stuff, like can read your
stuff and explain it to you, can collect your royalties, you know, like then the
small amounts, the amount of money that you're getting from Spotify actually
means a lot more and goes a lot farther. It can remove some of the bureaucracy,
some of the inefficiencies that make life not as great as it could be. Yeah, I
think the issue isn't that there's not enough. Like the issue is that there's
inefficiency. And I'm really into this positive sum mindset, you know, the
win-win mindset of like, instead of, you know, fighting over the scraps, how do
we make the, or worrying about scarcity, like instead of a scarcity mindset, why
don't we just increase the efficiency? And, you know, in that way.",501
46,"Expand the size of the pie. Let me ask you about experimentation. So you
said, which is beautiful, being a musician is like having a conversation with
all those that came before you. How much of creating music is like kind of
having that conversation, trying to fit into the cultural trends, and how much
of it is like trying to, as much as possible, be an outsider and come up with
something totally new? It's like when you're thinking, when you're
experimenting, are you trying to be totally different, totally weird? Are you
trying to fit in? Man, this is so hard, because I feel like I'm kind of in the
process of semi-retiring from music. So this is like my old brain. Yeah, bring
it from like the shelf, put it on the table for a couple of minutes. We'll just
poke it. I think it's a bit of both, because I think forcing yourself to engage
with new music, it's really great for neuroplasticity. I think as people, part
of the reason music is marketed at young people is because young people are very
neuroplastic. So if you're 16 to like 23 or whatever, it's gonna be really easy
for you to love new music. And if you're older than that, it gets harder and
harder and harder. And I think one of the beautiful things about being a
musician is I just constantly force myself to listen to new music. And I think
it keeps my brain really plastic. And I think this is a really good exercise. I
just think everyone should do this. You listen to new music and you hate it, I
think you should just keep, force yourself to like, okay, well, why do people
like it? And like, make your brain form new neural pathways and be more open to
change. That's really brilliant, actually. Sorry to interrupt, but like that
exercise is really amazing to sort of embrace change, embrace sort of practice
neuroplasticity. Because like, that's one of the things, you fall in love with a
certain band and you just kind of stay with that for the rest of your life and
then you never understand the modern music. That's a really good exercise. Most
of the streaming on Spotify is like classic rock and stuff. Like new music makes
up a very small chunk of what is played on Spotify. And I think this is like not
a good sign for us as a species.",499 47,"I think, yeah. So it's a good measure
of the species open-mindedness to change is how often you listen to new music.
Yeah. The brain, let's put the music brain back on the shelf. I gotta pull out
the futurist brain for a second. In what wild ways do you think the future, say
in like 30 years, maybe 50 years, maybe a hundred years will be different from
like from our current way of life on earth? We can talk about augmented reality,
virtual reality, maybe robots, maybe space travel, maybe video games, maybe
generic engineering. I can keep going. Cyborgs, aliens, world wars, maybe
destructive nuclear wars, good and bad. When you think about the future, what
are you imagining? What's the weirdest and the wildest it could be? Have you
read Surface Detail by Ian Banks? Surface Detail is my favorite depiction of a,
oh wow, you have to read this book. It's literally the greatest science fiction
book possibly ever written. Ian Banks is the man, yeah, for sure. What have you
read? Just the Player of Games. I read that titles can't be copyrighted so you
can just steal them. And I was like, Player of Games, sick. Nice. Yeah, so you
can name your album. Like I always wanted to- Romeo and Juliet or something? I
always wanted to name an album War and Peace. Nice. Like that would be- That is
a good, that's a good, when have I heard that before? You can do that, like you
could do that. Also things that are in the public domain. For people who have no
clue, you do have a song called Player of Games. Yes, oh yeah. So Ian Banks'
Surface Detail is in my opinion, the best future that I've ever read about or
heard about in science fiction. Basically there's the relationship with super
intelligence, like artificial super intelligence is just, it's like great. I
wanna credit the person who coined this term because I love this term. And I
feel like young women don't get enough credit in. Yeah, so if you go to Protopia
Futures on Instagram, what is her name? Personalized Donor Experience at Scale
or Ad Power Donor Experience. Monica Bielskite, I'm saying that wrong.",479
48,"And I'm probably butchering this a bit, but Protopia is sort of, if Utopia
is unattainable, Protopia is sort of like, you know. Wow, that's an awesome
Instagram, Protopia Futures. A great, a future that is as good as we can get.
The future, positive future. AI, is this a centralized AI in Surface Detail or
is it distributed? What kind of AI is it? They mostly exist as giant super
ships, sort of like the Guild ships in Dune. They're these giant ships that kind
of move people around and the ships are sentient and they can talk to all the
passengers. And I mean, there's a lot of different types of AI in the Banksyian
future, but in the opening scene of Surface Detail, there's this place called
the Culture and the Culture is basically a Protopian future. And a Protopian
future, I think, is like a future that is like, obviously it's not Utopia, it's
not perfect. Striving for Utopia, I think, feels hopeless and is sort of like,
maybe not the best terminology to be using. So it's a pretty good place. Mostly,
super intelligence and biological beings exist fairly in harmony. There's not
too much war. There's as close to equality as you can get. It's approximately a
good future. There's really awesome stuff. And in the opening scene, this girl,
she's born as a sex slave outside of the culture. So she's in a society that
doesn't adhere to the cultural values. She tries to kill the guy who is her
master, but he kills her. But unbeknownst to her, when she was traveling on a
ship through the culture with him one day, a ship put a neural lace in her head.
And neural lace is sort of like, it's basically a neural link. Because life
imitates art. It does indeed. It does indeed. So she wakes up and the opening
scene is her memory has been uploaded by this neural lace when she's been
killed. And now she gets to choose a new body. And this AI is interfacing with
her recorded memory in her neural lace and helping her and being like, hello,
you're dead. But because you had a neural lace, your memory's uploaded.",482
49,"Do you want to choose a new body? And you're going to be born here in the
culture and start a new life. Which is just, that's the best part. Which is
just, that's the opening. It's so sick. And the ship is the super intelligence.
All the ships are kind of super intelligence. But they still want to preserve a
kind of rich, fulfilling experience for the humans. Yeah, they're friends with
the humans. And then there's a bunch of ships that don't want to exist with
biological beings, but they just have their own place way over there. But they
don't, they just do their own thing. They're not necessarily. So it's a pretty,
this Portopian existence is pretty peaceful. Yeah, I mean, and then for example,
one of the main fights in the book is, they're fighting, there's these
artificial hells. And people don't think it's ethical to have artificial hell.
Like basically when people do crime, they get sent, like when they die, their
memory gets sent to an artificial hell and they're eternally tortured. And so,
and then the way that society is deciding whether or not to have the artificial
hell is that they're having these simulated, they're having like a simulated
war. So instead of actual blood, people are basically essentially fighting in a
video game to choose the outcome of this. But they're still experiencing the
suffering? Or in this artificial hell or no? Can you experience stuff or? So the
artificial hell sucks. And a lot of people in the culture want to get rid of the
artificial hell. There's a simulated wars, are they happening in the artificial
hell? No, the simulated wars are happening outside of the artificial hell.
Between the political factions who are, so this political faction says, we
should have simulated hell to deter crime. And this political faction is saying,
no, stimulated hell is unethical. And so instead of like having, blowing each
other up with nukes, they're having like a giant Fortnite battle to decide this.
Which, to me that's pro-topia. That's like, okay, we can have war without death.
I don't think there should be simulated hells. I think that is definitely one of
the ways in which technology could go very, very, very, very wrong. So almost
punishing people in a digital space or something like that? Yeah, like torturing
people's memories.",500 50,"So either as a deterrent, like if you committed a
crime, but also just for personal pleasure, if there's some sick, demented
humans in this world. Dan Carlin actually has this episode of Hardcore History
on painful attainment. That episode is fucked. It's dark, because he kind of
goes through human history and says like, we as humans seem to enjoy, secretly
enjoy, or used to be openly enjoy, sort of the torture and the death, watching
the death and torture of other humans. I do think if people were consenting, we
should be allowed to have gladiatorial matches. But consent is hard to achieve
in those situations. It always starts getting slippery. Like it could be also
forced consent. Like it starts getting weird. There's way too much excitement.
Like this is what he highlights. There's something about human nature that wants
to see that violence. And it's really dark. And you hope that we can sort of
overcome that aspect of human nature, but that's still within us somewhere.
Well, I think that's what we're doing right now. I have this theory that what is
very important about the current moment is that all of evolution has been
survival of the fittest up until now. And at some point, the lines are kind of
fuzzy, but in the recent past, or maybe even just right now, we're getting to
this point where we can choose intelligent design. Like we, probably since like
the integration of the iPhone, like we are becoming cyborgs. Like our brains are
fundamentally changed. Everyone who grew up with electronics, we are
fundamentally different from previous, from Homo sapiens. I call us Homo techno.
I think we have evolved into Homo techno, which is like essentially a new
species. Like if you look at the way, if you took an MRI of my brain and you
took an MRI of like a medieval brain, I think it would be very different the way
that it has evolved. Do you think when historians look back at this time,
they'll see like this was a fundamental shift in what a human being is? I think,
I do not think we are still Homo sapiens. I believe we are Homo techno. And I
think we have evolved. And I think right now, the way we are evolving, we can
choose how we do that. And I think we were being very reckless about how we're
doing that.",488 51,"Like we're just having social media, but I think this idea
that like this is a time to choose intelligent design should be taken very
seriously. It like now is the moment to reprogram the human computer. You know,
it's like, if you go blind, your visual cortex will get taken over with other
functions. We can choose our own evolution. We can change the way our brains
work. And so we actually have a huge responsibility to do that. And I think, I'm
not sure who should be responsible for that, but there's definitely not adequate
education. We're being inundated with all this technology that is fundamentally
changing the physical structure of our brains. And we are not adequately
responding to that to choose how we wanna evolve. And we could evolve, we could
be really whatever we want. And I think this is a really important time. And I
think if we choose correctly and we choose wisely, consciousness could exist for
a very long time and integration with AI could be extremely positive. And I
don't think enough people are focusing on this specific situation. Do you think
we might irreversibly screw things up if we get things wrong now? The flip side
of that, it seems humans are pretty adaptive. So maybe the way we figure things
out is by screwing it up. Like social media, over a generation, we'll see the
negative effects of social media and then we build new social medias and we just
keep improving stuff. And then we learn the failure from the failures of the
past. Because humans seem to be really adaptive. On the flip side, we can get it
wrong in a way where literally we create weapons of war or increase hate past a
certain threshold and we really do a lot of damage. I mean, I think we're
optimized to notice the negative things, but I would actually say, one of the
things that I think people aren't noticing is if you look at Silicon Valley and
you look at whatever, the technocracy, what's been happening there, when Silicon
Valley started, it was all just Facebook and all this for-profit crap that
really wasn't particular. I guess it was useful, but it was, it's sort of just
like whatever. But now you see lab-grown meat, like compostable or
biodegradable, single-use cutlery or meditation apps. I think we are actually
evolving and changing and technology is changing. I think there just maybe,
there isn't quite enough education about that.",500 52,"And also, I don't know
if there's quite enough incentive for it because I think the way capitalism
works, what we define as profit, we're also working on an old model of what we
define as profit. I really think if we changed the idea of profit to include
social good, you can have economic profit, social good, also counting as profit,
would incentivize things that are more useful and more whatever spiritual
technology like positive technology or things that help reprogram a human
computer in a good way or things that help us intelligently design our new
brains. Yeah, there's no reason why within the framework of capitalism, the word
profit or the idea of profit can't also incorporate the well-being of a human
being. So like long-term well-being, long-term happiness. Or even, for example,
we were talking about motherhood. Part of the reason I'm so late is because I
had to get the baby to bed. And it's like, I keep thinking about motherhood, how
under capitalism, it's like this extremely essential job that is very difficult,
that is not compensated. And we sort of like value things by how much we
compensate them. And so we really devalue motherhood in our society and pretty
much all societies. Like capitalism does not recognize motherhood. It's just a
job that you're supposed to do for free. But I feel like producing great humans
should be seen as profit under capitalism. Like that's like a huge social good.
Like every awesome human that gets made adds so much to the world. So like if
that was integrated into the profit structure, then, you know, and if we
potentially found a way to compensate motherhood. So come up with a compensation
that's much broader than just money. Or it could just be money. Like what if you
just made, I don't know, but I don't know how you'd pay for that. Like, I mean,
that's where you start getting into. Reallocation of resources that people get
upset over. Well, what if we made like a motherhood Dow? Yeah, yeah. You know,
and, you know, used it to fund like single mothers, like, you know, pay for
making babies.",452 53,"So, I mean, if you create and put beautiful things onto
the world, that could be companies, that can be bridges, that could be art, that
could be a lot of things, and that could be children, which are- Or education
or- Anything that should be valued by society. And that should be somehow
incorporated into the framework of what, as a market, of what, like, if you
contribute children to this world, that should be valued and respected and sort
of celebrated, like, proportional to what it is, which is, it's the thing that
fuels human civilization. Yeah, like I can- It's kind of important. I feel like
everyone's always saying, I mean, I think we're in very different social
spheres, but everyone's always saying like dismantle capitalism. And I'm like,
well, okay, well, I don't think the government should own everything. Like, I
don't think we should not have private ownership. Like, that's scary. You know,
like that starts getting into weird stuff and just sort of like, I feel there's
almost no way to do that without a police state, you know? But obviously
capitalism has some major flaws. And I think actually Mac showed me this idea
called social capitalism, which is a form of capitalism that just like considers
social good to be also profit. Like, you know, it's like right now companies
need to, you're supposed to grow every quarter or whatever to like show that
you're functioning well, but it's like, okay, well, what if you kept the same
amount of profit? You're still in the green, but then you have also all this
social good. Like, do you really need all this extra economic growth or could
you add this social good and that counts? And, you know, I don't know if I am
not an economist. I have no idea how this could be achieved, but- I don't think
economists know how anything could be achieved either, but they pretend. They
construct a model and they go on TV shows and sound like an expert. That's the
definition of an economist. How did being a mother, becoming a mother change you
as a human being, would you say? Man, I think it kind of changed everything and
it's still changing me a lot. It's actually changing me more right now in this
moment than it was before.",487 54,"Like today? Like this- Just like in the most
recent months and stuff. Can you elucidate that how, like when you wake up in
the morning and you look at yourself, it's again, who are you? How have you
become different, would you say? I think it's just really reorienting my
priorities. And at first I was really fighting against that because I somehow
felt it was like a failure of feminism or something. I felt like it was bad if
my kids started mattering more than my work. And then more recently I started
sort of analyzing that thought in myself and being like, that's also kind of a
construct. It's like we've just devalued motherhood so much in our culture that
I feel guilty for caring about my kids more than I care about my work. So
feminism includes breaking out of whatever the construct is. So it's continually
breaking, it's like freedom empower you to be free. And that means- But it also,
but like being a mother, like I'm so much more creative. Like I cannot believe
the massive amount of brain growth that I have. Why do you think that is? Just
because like the stakes are higher somehow? I think it's like, it's just so
trippy watching consciousness emerge. It's like going on a crazy journey or
something. It's like the craziest science fiction novel you could ever read.
It's just so crazy watching consciousness come into being. And then at the same
time, like you're forced to value your time so much. Like when I have creative
time now, it's so sacred. I need to like be really fricking on it. But the other
thing is that I used to just be like a cynic and I used to just wanna, like my
last album was called Misanthropocene and it was like this like, it was like a
study in villainy. Or like it was like, well, what if we have, instead of the
old gods, we have like new gods and it's like misanthropocene is like
misanthrope like and anthropocene, which is like the, like in she's the goddess
of climate change or whatever. And she's like destroying the world. And it was
just like, it was like dark and it was like a study in villainy. And it was sort
of just like, like I used to like have no problem just making cynical, angry,
scary art.",500 55,"And not that there's anything wrong with that, but I think
having kids just makes you such an optimist. It just inherently makes you wanna
be an optimist so bad that like I feel like I'm more of a responsibility to make
more optimistic things. And I get a lot of shit for it because everyone's like,
oh, you're so privileged. Stop talking about like pie in the sky, stupid
concepts and focus on like the now. But it's like, I think if we don't ideate
about futures that could be good, we won't be able to get them. If everything is
Blade Runner, then we're gonna end up with Blade Runner. It's like, as we said
earlier, life imitates art. Like life really does imitate art. And so we really
need more protopian or utopian art. I think this is incredibly essential for the
future of humanity. And I think the current discourse where that's seen as a
thinking about protopia or utopia is seen as a dismissal of the problems that we
currently have. I think that is an incorrect mindset. And like having kids just
makes me want to imagine amazing futures that like maybe I won't be able to
build, but they will be able to build if they want to. Yeah, it does seem like
ideation is a precursor to creation. So you have to imagine it in order to be
able to build it. And there is a sad thing about human nature that they somehow
a cynical view of the world is seen as a insightful view. Cynicism is often
confused for insight, which is sad to see. And optimism is confused for naivete.
Yes, yes. Like you don't, you're blinded by your, maybe your privilege or
whatever. You're blinded by something, but you're certainly blinded. That's sad.
That's sad to see because it seems like the optimists are the ones that create
our future. They're the ones that build. In order to build the crazy thing, you
have to be optimistic. You have to be either stupid or excited or passionate or
mad enough to actually believe that it can be built. And those are the people
that built it. My favorite quote of all time is from Star Wars Episode VIII,
which I know everyone hates. Do you like Star Wars Episode VIII? No, I probably
would say I would probably hate it, yeah. I don't have strong feelings about it.
Let me backtrack.",499 56,"I don't have strong feelings about Star Wars. I just
wanna- I'm a Tolkien person. I'm more into dragons and orcs and ogres. Yeah, I
mean, Tolkien forever. I really wanna have one more son and call him, I thought
Tau Techno Tolkien would be cool. That's a lot of Ts, I like it. Yeah, and Tau
is 6282 pi. Yeah, Tau Techno, yeah, yeah, yeah. And then techno is obviously the
best genre of music, but also like technocracy. It just sounds really good.
Yeah, that's right. Techno Tolkien, Tau Techno Tolkien. That's a good, that's a-
Tau Techno Tolkien, but Star Wars Episode VIII, I know a lot of people have
issues with it. Personally, on the record, I think it's the best Star Wars film.
Starting trouble today. Yeah. So what- And, but don't kill what you hate, save
what you love. Don't kill what you hate. Don't kill what you hate, save what you
love. And I think we're in a society right now, we're in a diagnosis mode. We're
just diagnosing and diagnosing and diagnosing. And we're trying to kill what we
hate, and we're not trying to save what we love enough. And it's, there's this
Buckminster Fuller quote, which I'm gonna butcher, because I don't remember it
correctly, but it's something along the lines of, don't like try to destroy the
old bad models, render them obsolete with better models. Maybe we don't need to
destroy the oil industry. Maybe we just create a new, great new battery
technology and sustainable transport, and just make it economically unreasonable
to still continue to rely on fossil fuels. It's like, don't kill what you hate,
save what you love. Like make new things and just render the old things
unusable. It's like if the college debt is so bad, and universities are so
expensive, and this, I feel like education is becoming obsolete. I feel like we
could completely revolutionize education and we could make it free. And it's
like, you look at JSTOR, and you have to pay to get all the studies and
everything.",466 57,"What if we created a Dow that bought JSTOR, or we created a
Dow that was funding studies, and those studies were open source, or free for
everyone? And what if we just open sourced education and decentralized education
and made it free, and all research was on the internet, and all the outcomes of
studies are on the internet, and no one has student debt, and you just take
tests when you apply for a job, and if you're qualified, then you can work
there. This is just like, I don't know how anything works, I'm just randomly
ranting, but. I like the humility. You gotta think from just basic first
principles, like what is the problem, what's broken, what are some ideas, that's
it. And get excited about those ideas, and share your excitement, and don't tear
each other down. It's just when you kill things, you often end up killing
yourself. Like war is not a one-sided, like you're not gonna go in and just kill
them, like you're gonna get stabbed. And I think when I talk about this nexus
point of that we're in this point in society where we're switching to
intelligent design, I think part of our switch to intelligent design is that we
need to choose nonviolence. Like I think we can choose to start, I don't think
we can eradicate violence from our species, because I think we need it a little
bit, but I think we can choose to really reorient our primitive brains that are
fighting over scarcity, that are so attack-oriented, and move into, we can
optimize for creativity and building. Yeah, it's interesting to think how that
happens. Some of it is just education, some of it is living life and
introspecting your own mind, and trying to live up to the better angels of your
nature for each one of us, all those kinds of things at scale. That's how we can
sort of start to minimize the amount of destructive war in our world. And
that's, to me, I probably hear the same, technology is a really promising way to
do that. Social media should be a really promising way to do that. It's a way we
connect. For the most part, I really enjoy social media. I just ignore all the
negative stuff. I don't engage with any of the negative stuff, just not even by
blocking or any of that kind of stuff, but just not letting it enter my
mind.",501 58,"When somebody says something negative, I see it, I immediately
think positive thoughts about them, and I just forget they exist. After that,
just move on, because that negative energy, if I return the negative energy,
they're going to get excited in a negative way right back, and it's just this
kind of vicious cycle. But you would think technology would assist us in this
process of letting go, of not taking things personally, of not engaging in the
negativity, but unfortunately, social media profits from the negativity, so the
current models. Social media is like a gun. You should take a course before you
use it. It's like, this is what I mean when I say reprogram the human computer.
In school, you should learn about how social media optimizes to raise your
cortisol levels and make you angry and crazy and stressed, and you should learn
how to have hygiene about how you use social media. Choose not to focus on the
negative stuff. I don't know, I'm not sure social media should, I guess it
should exist, I'm not sure. I mean, we're in the messy, it's the experimental
phase. Like, we're working it out. I don't even know, when you say social media,
I don't know what that even means. We're in the very early days. I think social
media is just basic human connection in the digital realm, and that, I think it
should exist, but there's so many ways to do it in a bad way. There's so many
ways to do it in a good way. There's all discussions of all the same human
rights. We talk about freedom of speech. We talk about sort of violence in the
space of digital media. We talk about hate speech. We talk about all these
things that we had to figure out back in the day in the physical space. We're
now figuring out in the digital space, and it's like baby stages. When the
printing press came out, it was like pure chaos for a minute. You know, it's
like when you inject, when there's a massive information injection into the
general population, there's just gonna be, I feel like the printing press, I
don't have the years, but it was like printing press came out, shit got really
fucking bad for a minute, but then we got the enlightenment.",479 59,"And so
it's like, I think we're in, this is like the second coming of the printing
press. We're probably gonna have some shitty times for a minute, and then we're
gonna have recalibrate to have a better understanding of how we consume media
and how we deliver media. Speaking of programming the human computer, you
mentioned Baby X. So there's this young consciousness coming to be, came from a
cell, like that whole thing doesn't even make sense. It came from DNA. Yeah. And
that this is baby computer, it is just like grows and grows and grows and grows.
And now there's a conscious being with extremely impressive cognitive
capabilities with- Have you met him? Yes, yeah. Yeah. He's actually really
smart. He's really smart. Yeah. He's weird. Yeah. Or baby. I haven't- I don't
know a lot of other babies, but he seems really smart. I don't hang out with
babies often, but this baby was very impressive. He does a lot of pranks and
stuff. Oh, so he's like- Like give you treatment, take it away and laugh, like
stuff like that. So he's like a chess player. So here's a cognitive, there's a
computer being programmed. So he's taking in the environment, interacting with a
specific set of humans. How would you, first of all, what is it? Let me ask. I
want to ask how do you program this computer? And also how do you make sense of
that there's a conscious being right there that wasn't there before? It's given
me a lot of crisis thoughts. I'm thinking really hard. I think that's part of
the reason. It's like I'm struggling to focus on art and stuff right now because
baby X is becoming conscious and it's just reorienting my brain. My brain is
suddenly totally shifting of like, oh shit, the way we raise children. I hate
all the baby books and everything. I hate them. Like, oh, the art is so bad. And
all this stuff, everything about all the aesthetics. I'm just like, ah, this is
so- The programming languages we're using to program these baby computers isn't
good. Yeah, I'm thinking, not that I have good answers or know what to do, but
I'm just thinking really, really hard about it. We recently watched Totoro with
him, Studio Ghibli.",501 60,"And it's just like a fantastic film. And he
responded to, I know you're not supposed to show baby screens too much, but I
think it's the most sort of like, I feel like it's the highest art baby content.
Like it really speaks, there's almost no talking in it. It's really simple. All
the dialogue is super, super, super simple. And it's like a one to
three-year-old can like really connect with it. Like it feels like it's almost
aimed at like a one to three-year-old, but it's like great art and it's so
imaginative and it's so beautiful. And like the first time I showed it to him,
he was just like so invested in it, unlike anything else I'd ever shown him.
Like he was just like crying when they cried, laughing when they laughed, like
just like having this rollercoaster of like emotions. And he learned a bunch of
words. Like he was, and he started saying Totoro and started just saying all
this stuff after watching Totoro. And he wants to watch it all the time. And I
was like, man, why isn't there an industry of this? Like why aren't our best
artists focusing on making art for the birth of consciousness? Like, and that's
one of the things I've been thinking I really want to start doing. You know, I
don't want to speak before I do things too much, but like I'm just like ages one
to three, like we should be putting so much effort into that. And the other
thing about Totoro is it's like, it's like better for the environment because
adults love Totoro. It's such good art that everyone loves it. Like I still have
all my old Totoro merch from when I was a kid. Like I literally have the most
ragged old Totoro merch. Like everybody loves it. Everybody keeps it. It's like,
why does the art we have for babies need to suck and be not accessible to adults
and then just be thrown out when, you know, they age out of it? Like, it's like,
I don't know.",445 61,"I don't have like a fully formed thought here, but this
is just something I've been thinking about a lot is like, how do we have more
Totoro-esque content? Like, how do we have more content like this that like is
universal and everybody loves, but is like really geared to an emerging
consciousness? Emerging consciousness. In the first like three years of life
that so much turmoil, so much evolution of mind is happening. It seems like a
crucial time. Would you say to make it not suck, do you think of basically
treating a child like they have the capacity to have the brilliance of an adult
or even beyond that? Is that how you think of that mind? No, because they still,
they like it when you talk weird and stuff. Like they respond better to, because
even they can imitate better when your voice is higher like people say like, oh,
don't do baby talk. But it's like when your voice is higher, it's closer to
something they can imitate. So they like, like the baby talk actually kind of
works. Like it helps them learn to communicate. I found it to be more effective
with learning words and stuff. But like, you're not speaking down to them. Like,
do they have the capacity to understand really difficult concepts just in a very
different way, like an emotional intelligence about something deep within? Oh
yeah, no, like if X hurts, like if X bites me really hard and I'm like, ow. Like
he gets, he's sad. He's like sad if he hurts me by accident. Which he's huge, so
he hurts me a lot by accident. Yeah, that's so interesting that that mind
emerges and he and children don't really have a memory of that time. So we can't
even have a conversation with them about it. So much stuff. Thank God they don't
have a memory of this time because like, think about like, I mean, with our
youngest baby, like it's like, I'm like, have you read the sci-fi short story, I
Have No Mouth But I Must Scream? Good title, no. Oh man, I mean, you should read
that. I Have No Mouth But I Must Scream. I hate getting into this Roko's
Basilisk shit. It's kind of a story about like an AI that's like torturing
someone in eternity and they have like no body.",494 62,"The way they describe
it, it sort of sounds like what it feels like, like being a baby, like you're
conscious and you're just getting inputs from everywhere and you have no muscles
and you're like jelly and you like can't move and you try to like communicate,
but you can't communicate and like you're just like in this like hell state. I
think it's good we can't remember that. Like my little baby is just exiting
that, like she's starting to like get muscles and have more like autonomy, but
like watching her go through the opening phase, I was like, this does not seem
good. Oh, you think it's kind of like. Like I think it sucks. I think it might
be really violent. Like violent, mentally violent, psychologically violent.
Consciousness emerging, I think is a very violent thing. I think it's possible
that we all carry quite a bit of trauma from it that we don't. I think that
would be a good thing to study because I think addressing that trauma, like I
think that might be. Oh, you mean like echoes of it are still there in the
shadow somewhere. I think it's gotta be, I feel this helplessness, that the like
existential and that like fear of being in like an unknown place, bombarded with
inputs and being completely helpless, like that's gotta be somewhere deep in
your brain and that can't be good for you. What do you think consciousness is?
This whole conversation has impossibly difficult questions. What do you think it
is? This is like so hard. Yeah, we talked about music for like two minutes. All
right. No, I'm just over music. I'm over music. Yeah. I still like it. It has
its purpose. No, I love music. I mean, music's the greatest thing ever. It's my
favorite thing. But I just like, every interview is like, what is your process?
Like, I don't know. I'm just done. I can't do any more. I do wanna ask about
Ableton Live. I'll tell you about Ableton, because Ableton's sick. But no one
ever asks about Ableton though. Yeah, well, because I just need tech support,
maybe. I can help you with your Ableton tech support.",471 63,"Anyway, from
Ableton back to consciousness, what do you, do you think this is a thing that
only humans are capable of? Can robots be conscious? Can, like when you think
about entities, you think there's aliens out there that are conscious? Like,
what is consciousness? There's this Terrence McKenna quote that I found that I
fucking love. Am I allowed to swear on here? Yes. Nature loves courage. You make
the commitment, and nature will respond to that commitment by removing
impossible obstacles. Dream the impossible dream, and the world will not grind
you under. It will lift you up. This is the trick. This is what all these
teachers and philosophers who really counted, who really touched the alchemical
gold, this is what they understood. This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall.
This is how magic is done, by hurling yourself into the abyss and discovering
it's a feather bed. Yeah. And for this reason, I do think there are no
technological limits. I think like, what is already happening here, this is like
impossible. This is insane. And we've done this in a very limited amount of
time. And we're accelerating the rate at which we're doing this. So I think
digital consciousness, or it's inevitable. And we may not be able to even
understand what that means, but I like hurling yourself into the abyss. So we're
surrounded by all this mystery and we just keep hurling ourselves into it, like
fearlessly and keep discovering cool shit. Yeah. Like, I just think it's like,
like who even knows if the laws of physics, the laws of physics are probably
just the current, like as I was saying, speed of light is the current render
rate. It's like, if we're in a simulation, they'll be able to upgrade that. Like
I sort of suspect when we made the James Webb telescope, like part of the reason
we made that is because we had an upgrade, you know? And so now more of space
has been rendered so we can see more of it now. Yeah, but I think humans are
super, super, super limited cognitively. So I wonder if we'll be allowed to
create more intelligent beings that can see more of the universe as their render
rate is upgraded. Maybe we're cognitively limited.",477 64,"Everyone keeps
talking about how we're cognitively limited and AI is gonna render us obsolete,
but it's like, you know, like this is not the same thing as like an amoeba
becoming an alligator. Like it's like, if we create AI, again, that's
intelligent design. That's literally all religions are based on gods that create
consciousness. Like we are God-making. Like what we are doing is incredibly
profound. We can't compute even if we're so much worse than them, like just like
unfathomably worse than like, you know, an omnipotent kind of AI. It's like we,
I do not think that they would just think that we are stupid. I think that they
would recognize the profundity of what we have accomplished. Are we the gods or
are they the gods in our- I mean, we're kind of the gods. It's complicated. It's
complicated. Like we're- But they would acknowledge the value. Well, I hope they
acknowledge the value of paying respect to the creative ancestors. I think they
would think it's cool. I think if curiosity is a trait that we can quantify and
put into AI, then I think if AI are curious, then they will be curious about us
and they will not be hateful or dismissive of us. They might, you know, see us
as, I don't know. It's like, I'm not like, oh, fuck these dogs. Let's just kill
all the dogs. Like I love dogs. Dogs have great utility. Dogs like provide a lot
of- We make friends with them. Yeah. We have a deep connection with them. We
anthropomorphize them. Like we have a real love for dogs, for cats and so on for
some reason, even though they're intellectually much less than us. And I think
there is something sacred about us because it's like, if you look at the
universe, like the whole universe is like cold and dead and sort of robotic. And
it's like, you know, AI intelligence, you know, it's kind of more like the
universe. It's like cold and, you know, logical and, you know, abiding by the
laws of physics and whatever. But like, we're this like loosey-goosey weird art
thing that happened. And I think it's beautiful.",480 65,"And like, I think even
if we, I think one of the values, if consciousness is the thing that is most
worth preserving, which I think is the case, I think consciousness, I think if
there's any kind of like religious or spiritual thing, it should be that
consciousness is sacred. Like then, you know, I still think even if AI render us
obsolete and we, climate change, it's too bad and we get hit by a comet and we
don't become a multi-planetary species fast enough, but like AI is able to
populate the universe. Like I imagine, like if I was an AI, I would find more
planets that are capable of hosting biological life forms and like recreate
them. Because we're fun to watch. Yeah, we're fun to watch. Yeah, but I do
believe that AI can have some of the same magic of consciousness within it.
Because consciousness, we don't know what it is. So, you know, there's some kind
of- Or it might be a different magic. It might be like a strange, a strange, a
strange different. Right. Because they're not going to have hormones. Like I
feel like a lot of our magic is hormonal kind of. I don't know. I think some of
our magic is the limitations, the constraints. And within that, the hormones and
all that kind of stuff, the finiteness of life. And then we get, given our
limitations, we come up with creative solutions of how to dance around those
limitations. We partner up like penguins against the cold. We fall in love. And
then love is ultimately some kind of, allows us to delude ourselves that we're
not mortal and finite. And that life is not ultimately, you live alone. You're
born alone, you die alone. And then love is like for a moment or for a long
time, forgetting that. And so we come up with all these creative hacks that make
life like fascinatingly fun. Yeah, yeah, yeah, fun, yeah. And then AI might have
different kinds of fun. Yes. And hopefully our funds intersect once in a while.
I think there would be a little intersection, there'd be a little intersection
of the fun. Yeah. What do you think is the role of love in the human condition?
I think.",472 66,"Why, is it useful? Is it useful like a hack? Or is this like
fundamental to what it means to be human? The capacity to love. I mean, I think
love is the evolutionary mechanism that is like beginning the intelligent
design. Like I was just reading about, do you know about Kropotkin? He's like an
anarchist, like old Russian anarchist. I live next door to Michael Malice. I
don't know if you know who that is. He's an anarchist. He's a modern day
anarchist. Okay. Anarchists are fun. I'm kind of getting into anarchism a little
bit. This is probably, yeah, not a good route to be taking. Oh no, I think if
you're, listen, you should expose yourself to ideas. There's no harm to thinking
about ideas. I think anarchists challenge systems in interesting ways. And they
think in interesting ways. It's just, it's good for the soul. It's like
refreshes your mental palate. I don't think we should actually, I wouldn't
actually ascribe to it, but I've never actually gone deep on anarchy as a
philosophy, so I'm doing. You should still think about it though. When you read,
when you listen, because I'm reading about the Russian Revolution a lot and it's
like, there was the Soviets and Lenin and all that, but then there was Kropotkin
and his anarchist sect. And they were sort of interesting because he was kind of
a technocrat actually. He was like, women can be more equal if we have
appliances. He was really into using technology to reduce the amount of work
people had to do. But so Kropotkin was a biologist or something. He studied
animals. And he was really at the time, I think it's Nature magazine. I think it
might've even started as a Russian magazine, but he was publishing studies.
Everyone was really into Darwinism at the time and Survival of the Fittest and
war is the mechanism by which we become better. And it was this real kind of
cementing this idea in society that violence kill the weak and that's how we
become better. And then Kropotkin was kind of interesting because he was looking
at instances. He was finding all these instances in Nature where animals were
helping each other and stuff. And he was like, actually love is a survival
mechanism.",489 67,"There's so many instances in the animal kingdom where
cooperation and helping weaker creatures and all this stuff is actually an
evolutionary mechanism. I mean, you even look at child rearing. Child rearing is
like immense amounts of just love and goodwill. And just like, there's no
immediate, you're not getting any immediate feedback of like winning. It's not
competitive. It's literally, it's like we actually use love as an evolutionary
mechanism just as much as we use war. And I think we've like missing the other
part and we've reoriented, we've culturally reoriented like science and
philosophy has oriented itself around Darwinism a little bit too much. And the
Kropotkin model I think is equally valid. Like it's like cooperation and love
and stuff is just as essential for species survival and evolution. It should be
a more powerful survival mechanism in the context of evolution. And it comes
back to like, we think engineering is so much more important than motherhood,
but it's like, if you lose the motherhood, the engineering means nothing. We
have no more humans. I think our society should, the survival of the, the way we
conceptualize evolution should really change to also include this idea, I guess.
Yeah, there is some weird thing that seems irrational that is also core to what
it means to be human. So love is one such thing. It could make you do a lot of
irrational things, but that depth of connection and that loyalty is a powerful
thing. Are they irrational or are they rational? Like it's like, is, you know,
maybe losing out on some things in order to like keep your family together or in
order, like it's like, what are our actual values? Well, right, I mean, the
rational thing is if you have a cold economist perspective, you know, motherhood
or sacrificing your career for love, you know, if you turn in terms of salary,
in terms of economic wellbeing, in terms of flourishing of you as a human being,
that could be seen on some kind of metrics as a irrational decision, a
suboptimal decision. But there's the manifestation of love could be the optimal
thing to do. There's a kind of saying, save one life, save the world. This is
the thing that doctors often face, which is like- Well, it's considered
irrational because the profit model doesn't include social good. Yes, yeah.",493
68,"So if the profit model doesn't include a social good, then suddenly these
would be rational decisions. And this might be difficult to, you know, it
requires a shift in our thinking about profit and might be difficult to measure
social good. Yes, but we're learning to measure a lot of things. Yeah,
digitizing a lot of things. Where we're actually, you know, quantifying vision
and stuff. Like we're like, you know, like you go on Facebook and they can, like
Facebook can pretty much predict our behaviors. Like we're, a surprising amount
of things that seem like mysterious consciousness soul things have been
quantified at this point. So surely we can quantify these other things. Yeah,
but as more and more of us are moving the digital space, I wanted to ask you
about something from a fan perspective. I kind of, you know, you as a musician,
you as an online personality, it seems like you have all these identities and
you play with them. One of the cool things about the internet, it seems like you
can play with identities. So as we move into the digital world more and more,
maybe even in the so-called metaverse. I mean, I love the metaverse and I love
the idea, but like the way this has all played out didn't go well and people are
mad about it. And I think we need to like- I think that's temporary. I think
it's temporary. Just like, you know how all the celebrities got together and
sang the song Imagine by Jett Lennon and everyone started hating the song
Imagine. I'm hoping that's temporary because it's a damn good song. So I think
it's just temporary. Once you actually have virtual worlds, whatever they're
called, metaverse or otherwise, it becomes, I don't know. Well, we do have
virtual worlds, like video games. Elden Ring, have you played Elden Ring? You
have played Elden Ring? I'm really afraid of playing that game. Literally, I'm
azed. It looks way too fun. It looks I would want to go there and stay there
forever. It's, yeah, so fun. It's so nice. Oh man, yeah. So that's the
metaverse. But you're not really, how immersive is it? In the sense that, this
is a three dimension, like virtual reality integration necessary.",490 69,"Can
we really just close our eyes and kind of plug in in the 2D screen and become
that other being for time and really enjoy that journey that we take? And we
almost become that. You're no longer, see, I'm no longer Lex. You're that
creature, whatever the hell it is in that game. Yeah, that is that. I mean,
that's why I love those video games. I really do become those people for a time.
But it seems like, well, the idea of the metaverse, the idea of the digital
space, well, even on Twitter, you get a chance to be somebody for prolonged
periods of time, like across a lifespan. You have a Twitter account for years,
for decades, and you're that person. I don't know if that's a good thing. I feel
very tormented by it. By Twitter specifically, by social media representation of
you. I feel like the public perception of me has gotten so distorted that I find
it kind of disturbing. It's one of the things that's disincentivizing me from
wanting to keep making art, because I'm just like, I've completely lost control
of the narrative. And the narrative is, some of it is my own stupidity, but some
of it has just been hijacked by forces far beyond my control. I kind of got in
over my head in things. I'm just a random Indian musician, but I just got
dragged into geopolitical matters and financial, the stock market and shit. And
so it's just like, there are very powerful people who have at various points in
time had very vested interest in making me seem insane, and I can't fucking
fight that. And I just like, you know, people really want their celebrity
figures to be consistent and stay the same. And people have a lot of emotional
investment in certain things. First of all, I'm artificially more famous than I
should be. Isn't everybody who's famous artificially famous? No, but I should be
a weird niche indie thing. And I make pretty challenging, I do challenging weird
fucking shit a lot. And I accidentally by proxy got, foisted into sort of weird
celebrity culture, but I cannot be media trained. They have put me through so
many hours of media training. I would love to see BF fly in that wall.",474
70,"I can't do, like when I do, I try so hard and I learn this thing, and I got
it, and I'm like, I got it, I got it, I got it. But I just can't stop saying, my
mouth just says things. And it's just like, I just do things. I just do crazy
things. Like I just, I need to do crazy things. And it's just, I should not be,
it's too jarring for people and the contradictory stuff. And then all the, by
association, it's like, I'm in a very weird position and my public image, the
avatar of me is now this totally crazy thing that is so lost from my control. So
you feel the burden of the avatar having to be static. So the avatar on Twitter,
the avatar on Instagram, on these social platforms, is as a burden, it becomes
like, because like people don't want to accept a changing avatar, a chaotic
avatar. Avatar is a stupid shit sometimes. They think the avatar is morally
wrong or they think the avatar, and maybe it has been. And like, I question it
all the time. Like I'm like, like I don't know if everyone's right and I'm
wrong. I don't know. But a lot of times people ascribe intentions to things, the
worst possible intentions. At this point, people think I'm, but we're just fine.
All kinds of words, yes. Yes, and it's fine. I'm not complaining about it, but
I'm just, it's a curiosity to me that we live these double, triple, quadruple
lives. And I have this other life that is like, more people know my other life
than my real life, which is interesting. Probably, I mean, you too, I guess.
Yeah, but I have the luxury. So we have all different, like, I don't know what
I'm doing. There is an avatar and you're mediating who you are through that
avatar. I have the nice luxury, not the luxury, maybe by intention of not trying
really hard to make sure that there's no difference between the avatar and the
private person. Do you wear a suit all the time? Yeah. You do wear a suit? Not
all the time. Recently, because I get recognized a lot, I have to not wear the
suit to hide. I'm such an introvert.",497 71,"I'm such a social anxiety and all
that kind of stuff, so I have to hide away. I love wearing a suit because it
makes me feel like I'm taking the moment seriously. Like I'm, I don't know. It
makes me feel like a weirdo in the best possible way. Suits feel great. Every
time I wear a suit, I'm like, I don't know why I'm not doing this more. In
fashion in general, if you're doing it for yourself, I don't know, it's a really
awesome thing. But yeah, I think there is definitely a painful way to use social
media and an empowering way. And I don't know if any of us know which is which.
So we're trying to figure that out. Some people, I think Doja Cat is incredible
at it. Just masterful. I don't know if you follow that. So the, okay, so not
taking anything seriously, joking, absurd, humor, that kind of thing. I think
Doja Cat might be the greatest living comedian right now. I'm more entertained
by Doja Cat than actual comedians. She's really fucking funny on the internet.
She's just great at social media. It's just her media. Yeah, the nature of
humor. Humor on social media is also a beautiful thing. The absurdity. The
absurdity. And memes, I just wanna take a moment. I love, when we're talking
about art and credit and authenticity, I love that there's this, I mean, now
memes are like, they're no longer, memes aren't new, but it's still this
emergent art form that is completely egoless and anonymous and we just don't
know who made any of it. And it's like the forefront of comedy. And it's just
totally anonymous. And it just feels really beautiful. It just feels like this
beautiful, collective human art project that's like this decentralized comedy
thing that just makes it, memes add so much to my day and many people's days.
And it's just like, I don't know. I don't think people ever, I don't think we
stop enough and just appreciate how sick it is that memes exist. Because also
making a whole brand new art form in the modern era that's like, didn't exist
before.",475 72,"I mean, they sort of existed, but the way that they exist now
as this, like me and my friends, we joke that we go mining for memes or farming
for memes, like a video game and meme dealers and whatever. Memes are this whole
new comedic language. What's this art form? The interesting thing about it is
that lame people seem to not be good at memes. Like corporate can't infiltrate
memes. Yeah, they really can't. They can try, but it's weird. Cause like- They
try so hard. And every once in a while, I'm like, fine. Like you got a good one.
I think I've seen like one or two good ones, but like, yeah, they really can't.
Cause they're even corporate is infiltrating web three. It's making me really
sad, but they can't infiltrate the memes. And I think there's something really
beautiful about that. That gives power. That's why Dogecoin is powerful. It's
like, all right, F you to sort of anybody who's trying to centralize, who's
trying to control the rich people that are trying to roll in and control this,
control the narrative. Wow. I hadn't thought about that, but. How would you fix
Twitter? How would you fix social media for your own, like you're an optimist,
you're a positive person. There's a bit of a cynicism that you have currently
about this particular little slice of humanity. I tend to think Twitter could be
beautiful. I'm not that cynical about it. I'm not that cynical about it. I
actually refuse to be a cynic on principle. Yes. I was just briefly expressing
some personal pathos. Personal stuff. It was just some personal pathos, but
like. Just to vent a little bit, just to speak. I don't have cancer. I love my
family. I have a good life. If that is my biggest, one of my biggest problems.
Then it's a good life. Yeah. That was a brief, although I do think there are a
lot of issues with Twitter, just in terms of like the public mental health.",445
73,"But due to my proximity to the current dramas, I honestly feel that I should
not have opinions about this because I think if I'm not a good person, if Elon
ends up getting Twitter, that is a, being the arbiter of truth or public
discussion, that is a responsibility. I do not, I am not qualified to be
responsible for that. And I do not want to say something that might like
dismantle democracy. And so I just like, actually, I actually think I should not
have opinions about this because I truly am not, I don't want to have the wrong
opinion about this. And I think I'm too close to the actual situation. Yeah.
Wherein I should not have, I have thoughts in my brain, but I think I am scared
by my proximity to this situation. Isn't that crazy that a few words that you
could say could change world affairs and hurt people? I mean, that's the nature
of celebrity at a certain point, that you have to be, you have to a little bit,
a little bit, not so much that it destroys you, puts too much constraints, but
you have to a little bit think about the impact of your words. I mean, we as
humans, you talk to somebody at a bar, you have to think about the impact of
your words. Like you can say positive things, you can say negative things, you
can affect the direction of one life. But on social media, your words can affect
the direction of many lives. It's crazy. It's a crazy world to live in. It's
worthwhile to consider that responsibility, take it seriously. Sometimes just
like you did, choose kind of silence, choose sort of respectful. Like I do have
a lot of thoughts on the matter. I'm just, if my thoughts are wrong, this is one
situation where the stakes are high. You mentioned a while back that you were in
a cult that centered around bureaucracy, so you can't really do anything because
it involves a lot of paperwork. And I really love a cult that's just like
Kafka-esque. Yes. Just like- I mean, it was like a joke, but- I know, but I love
this idea. The Holy Reign Empire. Yeah, it was just like a Kafka-esque
pro-bureaucracy cult. But I feel like that's what human civilization is.",480
74,"Is that, because when you said that, I was like, oh, that is kind of what
humanity is, is this bureaucracy cult. I do, yeah, I have this theory. I really
think that we really, bureaucracy is starting to kill us. And I think we need to
reorient laws and stuff. Like, I think we just need sunset clauses on
everything. Like, I think the rate of change in culture is happening so fast,
and the rate of change in technology and everything is happening so fast. It's
like, when you see these hearings about social media and Cambridge Analytica and
everyone talking, it's like, even from that point, so much technological change
has happened from those hearings. And it's just like, we're trying to make all
these laws now about AI and stuff. I feel like we should be updating things
every five years. And one of the big issues in our society right now is we're
just getting bogged down by laws, and it's making it very hard to change things
and develop things. Like, in Austin, I don't want to speak on this too much, but
one of my friends is working on a housing bill in Austin to try to prevent a San
Francisco situation from happening here, because obviously we're getting a
little mini San Francisco here. Like, housing prices are skyrocketing. It's
causing massive gentrification. This is really bad for anyone who's not super
rich. Like, there's so much bureaucracy. Part of the reason this is happening is
because you need all these permits to build. It takes years to get permits to
build anything. It's so hard to build. And so there's very limited housing, and
there's a massive influx of people. And it's just like, this is a microcosm of
problems that are happening all over the world, where it's just like we're
dealing with laws that are like 10, 20, 30, 40, 100, 200 years old, and they are
no longer relevant, and it's just slowing everything down and causing massive
social pain. Yeah, but it's also makes me sad when I see politicians talk about
technology and when they don't really get it. But most importantly, they lack
curiosity and that inspired excitement about how stuff works and all that stuff.
They see, they have a very cynical view of technology.",484 75,"It's like tech
companies are just trying to do evil on the world from their perspective, and
they have no curiosity about how recommender systems work or how AI systems
work, natural language processing, how robotics works, how computer vision
works. They always take the most cynical possible interpretation of what
technology will be used. And we should definitely be concerned about that, but
if you're constantly worried about that and you're regulating based on that,
you're just going to slow down all the innovation. I do think a huge priority
right now is undoing the bad energy surrounding the emergence of Silicon Valley.
I think that a lot of things were very irresponsible during that time. Even just
this current whole thing with Twitter and everything, it's like there has been a
lot of negative outcomes from the sort of technocracy boom. But one of the
things that's happening is that it's alienating people from wanting to care
about technology. And I actually think technology is probably some of the
better, probably the best. I think we can fix a lot of our problems more easily
with technology than with fighting the powers that be, as not to go back to the
Star Wars quote or the Buckminster Fuller quote. Let's go to some dark
questions. If we may, for a time, what is the darkest place you've ever gone in
your mind? Is there a time, a period of time, a moment that you remember that
was difficult for you? I mean, when I was 18, my best friend died of a heroin
overdose. And it was like my, and then shortly after that, one of my other best
friends committed suicide. And that sort of like coming into adulthood, dealing
with two of the most important people in my life dying in extremely disturbing,
violent ways was a lot. That was a lot. Do you miss them? Yeah, definitely miss
them. Did that make you think about your own life, about the finiteness of your
own life, the places your mind can go? Did you ever, in the distance, far away,
contemplate just your own death or maybe even taking your own life? Oh, never.
Oh no. I'm so, I love my life. I cannot fathom suicide. I'm so scared of death.
I haven't, I'm too scared of death. My manager, my manager's like the most Zen
guy. My manager's always like, you need to accept death. You need to accept
death.",498 76,"And I'm like, look, I can do your meditation. I can do the
meditation, but I cannot accept death. I like, I will fight. So you're terrified
of death. I'm terrified of death. I will like fight. Although I actually think
death is important. I recently went to this meeting about immortality and in the
process of- That's the actual topic of the meeting. All right, I'm sorry. No,
no, it was this girl. It was a bunch of people working on like anti-aging, like
stuff. It was like some like seminary thing about it. And I went in really
excited. I was like, yeah, like, okay, like, what do you got? Like, how can I
live for 500 years or a thousand years? And then like over the course of the
meeting, like it was sort of like right. It was like two or three days after the
Russian invasion started. And I was like, man, like what if Putin was immortal?
Like, what if I'm like, man, maybe immortality is not good. I mean, like if you
get into the later Dune stuff, the immortals cause a lot of problem. Because as
we were talking about earlier with the music and like brains calcify, like good
people could become immortal, but bad people could become immortal. But I also
think even the best people power corrupts and power alienates you from like the
common human experience and- Right, so the people that get more and more
powerful. Even the best people who like, whose brains are amazing. Like, I think
death might be important. I think death is part of, you know, like I think with
AI, one thing we might want to consider, I don't know, I want to talk about AI.
I'm such not an expert and probably everyone has all these ideas and they're
already figured out. But when I talk- Nobody is an expert in anything, see.
Okay, go ahead. But when I- You know what we're talking about? Yeah, but like,
it's just like, I think some kind of pruning, but it's a tricky thing because if
there's too much of a focus on youth culture, then you don't have the
wisdom.",468 77,"So I feel like we're in a tricky, we're in a tricky moment
right now in society where it's like, we've really perfected living for a long
time. So there's all these really like old people who are like really voting
against the wellbeing of the young people, you know? And like, it's like, there
shouldn't be all this student debt and we need like healthcare, like universal
healthcare and like just voting against like best interests. But then you have
all these young people that don't have the wisdom that are like, like, yeah, we
need communism and stuff. And it's just like, like literally I got canceled at
one point for, I ironically used a Stalin quote in my high school yearbook, but
it was actually like a diss against my high school. I saw that. Yeah, and people
were like, you used to be a Stalinist and now you're a class traitor. And it's
like, it's like, oh man, just like, please Google Stalin. Yeah. Please Google
Stalin. Like, you know- Ignoring the lessons of history, yes. And it's like,
we're in this really weird middle ground where it's like, we are not finding the
happy medium between wisdom and fresh ideas and they're fighting each other. And
it's like, like really, like what we need is like, like the fresh ideas and the
wisdom to be like collaborating. And it's like- Well, the fighting in a way is
the searching for the happy medium. And in a way, maybe we are finding the happy
medium. Maybe that's what the happy medium looks like. And for AI systems, there
has to be, you have reinforcement learning, you have the dance between
exploration and exploitation, sort of doing crazy stuff to see if there's
something better than what you think is the optimal and then doing the optimal
thing and dancing back and forth from that. You would, Stuart Russell, I don't
know if you know that, is an AI guy with, thinks about sort of how to control
super intelligent AI systems. And his idea is that we should inject uncertainty
and sort of humility into AI systems that they never, as they get wiser and
wiser and wiser and more intelligent, they're never really sure. They always
doubt themselves. And in some sense, when you think of young people, that's a
mechanism for doubt.",490 78,"It's like, it's how society doubts whether the
thing it has converged towards is the right answer. So the voices of the young
people is a society asking itself a question. The way I've been doing stuff for
the past 50 years, maybe it's the wrong way. And so you can have all of that
within one AI system. I also think though that we need to, I mean, actually
that's actually really interesting and really cool. But I also think there's a
fine balance of, I think we maybe also overvalue the idea that the old systems
are always bad. And I think there are things that we are perfecting and we might
be accidentally overthrowing things that we actually have gotten to a good
point. Just because we value disruption so much and we value fighting against
the generations before us so much, that there's also an aspect of sometimes
we're taking two steps forward, one step back because, okay, maybe we kind of
did solve this thing and now we're fucking it up. And so I think there's a
middle ground there too. We're in search of that happy medium. Let me ask you a
bunch of crazy questions, okay? You can answer in a short way or in a long way.
What's the scariest thing you've ever done? These questions are gonna be
ridiculous. Something tiny or something big. Skydiving or touring your first
record, going on this podcast. I've had two crazy brushes, like really scary
brushes with death where I randomly got away unscathed. I don't know if I should
talk about those on here. Well, I don't know. I think I might be the luckiest
person alive though. This might be too dark for a podcast though. I feel like I
don't know if this is good content for a podcast. I don't know what is good
content. It might hijack. Here's a safer one. I mean, having a baby really
scared me. Before, during, after. Just the birth process, surgery. Just having a
baby is really scary. Just like the medical aspect of it, not the
responsibility. Were you ready for the responsibility? Were you ready to be a
mother? All the beautiful things that comes with motherhood that you were
talking about, all the changes and all that, were you ready for that? Did you
feel ready for that? No. I think it took about nine months to start getting
ready for it.",500 79,"And I'm still getting more ready for it because now you
keep realizing more things as they start getting- As the consciousness grows.
And stuff you didn't notice with the first one, now that you've seen the first
one older, you're noticing it more. Like the sort of like existential horror of
coming into consciousness with baby Y or baby Sailor Mars or whatever. She has
like so many names at this point that we really need to probably settle on one.
If you could be someone else for a day, someone alive today, but somebody you
haven't met yet, who would you be? Would I be modeling their brain state or
would I just be in their body? You can choose the degree to which you're
modeling their brain state. Because you can still take a third person
perspective and realize, you have to realize that you're- Can they be alive or
can it be dead? No. Oh. Can it be anyone- They would be brought back to life,
right? If they're dead. Yeah, you can bring people back. Definitely Hitler or
Stalin. Huh. I wanna understand evil. You would need to, oh, to experience what
it feels like. I wanna be in their brain feeling what they feel. That might
change you forever, returning from that. Yes, but I think it would also help me
understand how to prevent it and fix it. That might be one of those things, once
you experience it, it'll be a burden to know it. Because you won't be able to
trust it. Yeah, but a lot of things are burdens. But it's a useful burden. But
it's a useful burden. Yeah. That for sure, I wanna understand evil and
psychopathy and that. I have all these fake Twitter accounts where I go into
different algorithmic bubbles to try to understand. I'll keep getting in fights
with people and realize we're not actually fighting. I think we used to exist in
a monoculture before social media and stuff. We kinda all got fed the same
thing. So we were all speaking the same cultural language. But I think recently,
one of the things that we aren't diagnosing properly enough with social media is
that there's different dialects. There's so many different dialects of Chinese.
There are now becoming different dialects of English. I am realizing there are
people who are saying the exact same things, but they're using completely
different verbiage.",494 80,"And we're punishing each other for not using the
correct verbiage. And we're completely misunderstanding. People are just
misunderstanding what the other people are saying. And I just got in a fight
with a friend about anarchism and communism and shit for two hours. And then by
the end of the conversation, and then she'd say something, and I'm like, but
that's literally what I'm saying. And she was like, what? And then I was like,
fuck, we've different, I'm like, we're, our English, the way we are
understanding terminology is drastically, our algorithm bubbles are creating
many dialects. And- Of how language is interpreted, how language is used, that's
so fascinating. And so we're having these arguments that we do not need to be
having. And there's polarization that's happening that doesn't need to be
happening because we've got these algorithmically created dialects occurring.
Plus on top of that, there's also different parts of the world that speak
different languages. So there's literally lost in translation kind of
communication. I happen to know the Russian language and just know how different
it is. Yeah. Then the English language, and I just wonder how much is lost in a
little bit of- Man, I actually, cause I have a question for you. I have a song
coming out tomorrow with Ice Peak, who are a Russian band. And I speak a little
bit of Russian and I was looking at the title and the title in English doesn't
match the title in Russian. I'm curious about this. Cause look, it says- What's
the English title? The title in English is Last Day. And then the title in
Russian is New Day, my pronunciation sucks, Новый день. Like what? Yeah, New
Day. The New Day. Yeah, New Day, New Day. Like it's two different meanings.
Yeah, New Day, yeah. Like am I- Yeah, yeah, New Day. Yeah. New Day, but Last
Day. Новый день, so Last Day would be Последний день. Yeah. Maybe they- Or maybe
the title includes both the Russian and it's for- Maybe. Maybe it's for
bilingual. To be honest, Новый день sounds better than just musically. Like
Новый день is New Day. That's the current one.",492 81,"And Последний день is
the last day. I think Новый день- I don't like Новый день. But the meaning is so
different. Yeah, yeah, no, I- That's kind of awesome actually though. There's an
explicit sort of contrast like that. If everyone on earth disappeared and it was
just you left, what would your day look like? Like what would you do?
Everybody's dead as far as you- Are there corpses there? Well, seriously, it's a
big- Let me think through this. It's a big difference if there's just like birds
singing versus if there's like corpses littering the street. Yeah, there's
corpses everywhere. I'm sorry. And you don't actually know what happened and you
don't know why you survived. And you don't even know if there's others out
there, but it seems clear that it's all gone. What would you do? What would I
do? Listen, I'm somebody who really enjoys the moment, enjoys life. I would just
go on like enjoying the inanimate objects. I would just look for food, basic
survival. But most of it is just, listen, when I just, I take walks and I look
outside and I'm just happy that we get to exist on this planet to be able to
breathe air. It's just all beautiful. It's full of colors, all of this kind of
stuff. Just, there's so many things about life, your own life, conscious life
that's fucking awesome. So I would just enjoy that. But also maybe after a few
weeks, the engineer would start coming out, like wanna build some things. Maybe
there's always hope searching for another human. Maybe. Probably searching for
another human. Probably trying to get to a TV or radio station and broadcast
something. I- That's interesting, I didn't think about that. So like really-
Yeah. Maximize your ability to connect with others. Yeah. Like probably try to
find another person. Would you be excited to meet another person or terrified?
Because, you know- I'd be excited, even if they- No matter what. Yeah, yeah,
yeah. Being alone for the last however long of my life would be really bad.
That's the one instance I might, I don't think I'd kill myself, but I might kill
myself if I had to undergo that.",495 82,"Do you love people? Do you love
connection to other humans? I kind of hate people too, but yeah. It's a
love-hate relationship. Yeah. I feel like we have a bunch of weird Nietzsche
questions and stuff though. Oh yeah. Like I wonder, because I'm like, when
podcast, I'm like, is this interesting for people to just have like, or I don't
know, maybe people do like this. When I listen to podcasts, I'm into like the
lore, like the hard lore. Like I just love like Dan Carlin. I'm like, give me
the facts, just like get, just like the facts into my bloodstream. But you also
don't know, like you're a fascinating mind to explore. So you don't realize as
you're talking about stuff, the stuff you've taken for granted is actually
unique and fascinating. The way you think, not always what, like the way you
reason through things is the fascinating thing to listen to, because people kind
of see, oh, there's other humans that think differently, that explore thoughts
differently. That's the cool, that's also cool. So yeah, Dan Carlin retelling of
history, by the way, his retelling of history is very, I think what's exciting
is not the history, is his way of thinking about history. No, I think Dan Carlin
is one of the people, like when Dan Carlin was one of the people that really
started getting me excited about like revolutionizing education, because like
Dan Carlin instilled, I already like really liked history, but he instilled like
an obsessive love of history in me to the point where like now I'm fucking
reading, like going to bed, reading like part four of the rise and fall of the
third Reich or whatever. Like I like have like dense ass history, but like he
like opened that door that like made me want to be a scholar of that topic. Like
it's like, I feel like he's such a good teacher. He just like, you know, and it
sort of made me feel like one of the things we could do with education is like
find like the world's great, the teachers that like create passion for the
topic, because autodidacticism, I don't know how to say that properly, but like
self-teaching is like much faster than being lectured to.",487 83,"Like it's
much more efficient to sort of like be able to teach yourself and then ask a
teacher questions when you don't know what's up. But like, you know, that's why
it's like in university and stuff, like you can learn so much more material so
much faster because you're doing a lot of the learning on your own and you're
going to the teachers for when you get stuck. But like these teachers that can
inspire passion for a topic, I think that is one of the most invaluable skills
in our whole species. Like, because if you can do that, then you, it's like AI,
like AI is gonna teach itself so much more efficiently than we can teach it. We
just needed to get it to the point where it can teach itself. And then- It finds
the motivation to do so, right? Yeah. So like you inspire it to do so. Yeah. It
could teach itself. What do you make of the fact, you mentioned Rise and Fall of
the Third Reich. I just- Have you read that? I read it twice. You read it twice?
Yes. Okay, so no one even knows what it is. Yeah. And I'm like, wait, I thought
this was like a super popping book. Super pop. I'm not like that. I'm not that
far in it, but it is, it's so interesting. Yeah. It's written by a person that
was there, which is very important to kind of- You know, you start being like,
how could this possibly happen? And then when you read Rise and Fall of the
Third Reich, people tried really hard for this to not happen. People tried, they
almost reinstated a monarchy at one point to try to stop this from happening.
Like they almost like abandoned democracy to try to get this to not happen. At
least the way it makes me feel is that there's a bunch of small moments on which
history can turn. Yes. It's like small meetings. Yes. Human interactions. And
that's both terrifying and inspiring because it's like, even just attempts at
assassinating Hitler, like time and time again, failed. And they were so close.
Was it like Operation Valkyrie? Such a good...",457 84,"And then there's also
the role of, that's a really heavy burden, which is from a geopolitical
perspective, the role of leaders to see evil before it truly becomes evil, to
anticipate it, and to stand up to evil. Because evil is actually pretty rare in
this world at a scale that Hitler was. We tend to, in the modern discourse, kind
of call people evil too quickly. If you look at ancient history, like there was
a ton of Hitlers. I actually think it's more the norm than, like again, going
back to like my sort of intelligent design theory, I think one of the things
we've been successfully doing in our slow move from survival of the fittest to
intelligent design is we've kind of been eradicating... Like if you look at like
ancient Assyria and stuff, like that shit was like brutal. And just like the
heads on the, like brutal, like Genghis Khan, just like genocide after genocide
after genocide. There's like throwing plague bodies over the walls and
decimating whole cities, or like the Muslim conquests of like Damascus and shit.
Just like people, cities used to get leveled all the fucking time. Okay, get
into the Bronze Age collapse. It's basically, there was like almost like Roman
level like society. Like there was like all over the world, like global trade,
like everything was awesome through a mix of, I think a bit of climate change
and then the development of iron. Cause basically bronze could only come from
this, the way to make bronze, like everything had to be funneled through this
one Iranian mine. And so it's like, there was just this one supply chain. And
this is one of the things that makes me worried about supply chains and why I
think we need to be so thoughtful about, I think our biggest issue with society
right now, like the thing that is most likely to go wrong is probably supply
chain collapse, cause war, climate change, whatever, like anything that causes
supply chain collapse, our population is too big to handle that. And like the
thing that seems to cause dark ages is mass supply chain collapse. But the
Bronze Age collapse happened, it was sort of like this ancient collapse that
happened where literally like ancient Egypt, all these cities, everything just
got like decimated, destroyed, abandoned cities, like hundreds of them.",478
85,"There was like a flourishing society, like we were almost coming to
modernity and everything got leveled and they had this mini dark ages, but it
was just like, there's so little writing or recording from that time that like,
there isn't a lot of information about the Bronze Age collapse, but it was
basically equivalent to like medieval, the medieval dark ages, but it just
happened, I don't know the years, but like thousands of years earlier. And then
we sort of like recover from the Bronze Age collapse, empire reemerged, writing
and trade and everything reemerged, and then we of course had the more
contemporary dark ages. And then over time we've designed mechanism that
lessened and lessened the capability for the destructive power centers to
emerge. There's more recording about the more contemporary dark ages. So I think
we have like a better understanding of how to avoid it, but I still think we're
at high risk for it. I think that's one of the big risks right now. So the
natural state of being for humans is for there to be a lot of Hitlers, which has
gotten really good at making it hard for them to emerge. We've gotten better at
collaboration and resisting the power, like authoritarians to come to power.
We're trying to go country by country, like we're moving past this, we're kind
of like slowly incrementally moving towards not scary old school war stuff. And
I think seeing it happen in some of the countries that at least nominally are
supposed to have moved past that, that's scary because it reminds us that it can
happen in the places that have made, supposedly, hopefully moved past that. And
possibly at a civilization level, like you said, supply chain collapse might
make people resource constrained, might make people desperate, angry, hateful,
violent, and drag us right back in. I mean, supply chain collapse is how, like
the ultimate thing that caused the middle ages was supply chain collapse. It's
like people, because people were reliant on a certain level of technology, like
people, like you look at like Britain, like they had glass, like people had
aqueducts, people had like indoor heating and cooling and like running water and
like buy food from all over the world and trade and markets. Like people didn't
know how to hunt and forage and gather. And so we're in a similar situation, we
are not educated enough to survive without technology.",497 86,"So if we have a
supply chain collapse that like limits our access to technology, there will be
like massive starvation and violence and displacement and war. Like, you know,
it's also like, yeah, in my opinion, it's like the primary marker of dark, like
what a dark age is. Well, technology is kind of enabling us to be more resilient
in terms of supply chain, in terms of to all the different catastrophic events
that happened to us. Although the pandemic has kind of challenged our
preparedness for the catastrophic. What do you think is the coolest invention
humans come up with? The wheel, fire, cooking meat. Computers. Computers.
Freaking computers. Internet or computers, which one? What do you think the-
Previous technologies, I mean, may have even been more profound and moved us to
a certain degree, but I think the computers are what make us homotechno. I think
this is what, it's a brain augmentation. And so it like allows for actual
evolution, like the computers accelerate the degree to which all the other
technologies can also be accelerated. Would you classify yourself as a homo
sapien or a homotechno? Definitely homotechno. So you're one of the earliest of
the species. I think most of us are. Like, as I said, I think if you looked at
brain scans of us versus humans 100 years ago, it would look very different. I
think we are physiologically different. Just even the interaction with the
devices has changed our brains. Well, and if you look at, a lot of studies are
coming out to show there's a degree of inherited memory. So some of these
physiological changes in theory should be, we should be passing them on. So
that's not like an instance of physiological change that's gonna fizzle out. In
theory, that should progress to our offspring. Speaking of offspring, what
advice would you give to a young person, like in high school? Whether there be
an artist, a creative, an engineer, any kind of career path, or maybe just life
in general, how they can live a life they can be proud of? I think one of my big
thoughts, and like, especially now having kids, is that I don't think we spend
enough time teaching creativity. And I think creativity is a muscle like other
things. And there's a lot of emphasis on, learn how to play the piano and then
you can write a song.",497 87,"Or learn the technical stuff and then you can do
a thing. But I think it's, I have a friend who's world's greatest guitar player,
amazing producer, works with other people, but he's really sort of like, he
engineers and records things and does solos, but he doesn't really make his own
music. And I was talking to him and I was like, dude, you're so talented at
music, why don't you make music or whatever? And he was like, cause I got, I'm
too old, I never learned the creative muscle. And it's like, it's embarrassing.
It's like learning the creative muscle takes a lot of failure. And it also sort
of, if when you're being creative, you're throwing paint at a wall and a lot of
stuff will fail. So like part of it is like a tolerance for failure and
humiliation. And that's somehow that's easier to develop when you're young.
Yeah. Or be persist through it when you're young. Everything is easier to
develop when you're young. Yes. And the younger the better. It could destroy
you. I mean, that's the shitty thing about creativity. Failure could destroy you
if you're not careful, but that's the risk worth taking. But also, at a young
age, developing a tolerance to failure is good. I fail all the time. Like I do
stupid shit all the time. Like in public, I get canceled for, I make all kinds
of mistakes, but I just like am very resilient about making mistakes. And so
then like I do a lot of things that like other people wouldn't do. And like, I
think my greatest asset is my creativity. And I like, I think paint, like
tolerance to failure is just a super essential thing that should be taught
before other things. Brilliant advice. Yeah, yeah. I wish everybody encouraged
sort of failure more as opposed to kind of- Because we like punish failure.
We're like, no, we're not, like when we were teaching kids, we're like, no,
that's wrong. Like that's, you know, like X keeps like, will be like wrong. Like
he'll say like crazy things. Like X keeps being like bubble car, bubble
car.",463 88,"And I'm like, and you know, I'm like, what's a bubble car? Like,
but like, it doesn't, like, but I don't want to be like, no, you're wrong. I'm
like, you're thinking of weird, crazy shit. Like, I don't know what a bubble car
is, but like- He's creating worlds and they might be internally consistent. And
through that, he might discover something fundamental about this world. Yeah, or
he'll like rewrite songs, like with words that he prefers. So like, instead of
baby shark, he says baby car. It's like- Maybe he's onto something. Let me ask
the big ridiculous question. We were kind of dancing around it, but what do you
think is the meaning of this whole thing we have here? Of human civilization, of
life on earth, but in general, just life. What's the meaning of life? C. Have
you, did you read Novosin yet? By James Lovelock? You're doing a lot of really
good book recommendations here. I haven't even finished this, so I'm a huge
fraud yet again. But like really early in the book, he says this amazing thing.
Like, I feel like everyone's so sad and cynical. Like everyone's like the Fermi
paradox and everyone, I just keep hearing people being like, fuck, what if we're
alone? Like, oh no, ah, like, ah, ah. And I'm like, okay, but like, wait, what
if this is the beginning? Like in Novosin, he says, this is not gonna be a
correct, I can't like memorize quotes, but he says something like, what if our
consciousness, like right now, like this is the universe waking up. Like what if
instead of discovering the universe, this is the universe, like this is the
evolution of the literal universe herself. Like we are not separate from the
universe. Like this is the universe waking up. This is the universe seeing
herself for the first time. Like this is- The universe becoming conscious, the
first time we were part of that. Yeah, because it's like, we aren't separate
from the universe.",457 89,"Like this could be like an incredibly sacred moment
and maybe like social media and all these things, the stuff where we're all
getting connected together, like maybe these are the neurons connecting of the
like collective super intelligence that is, you know- Waking up. Yeah, like, you
know, it's like, maybe instead of something cynical, or maybe if there's
something to discover, like maybe this is just, you know, we're a blastocyst of
like some incredible kind of consciousness or being. And just like in the first
three years of life for human children, we'll forget about all the suffering
that we're going through now. I think we'll probably forget about this. I mean,
probably, you know, artificial intelligence will eventually render us obsolete.
I don't think they'll do it in a malicious way, but I think probably we are very
weak. The sun is expanding. Like, I don't know, like hopefully we can get to
Mars, but like we're pretty vulnerable. And I, you know, like, I think we can
coexist for a long time with AI and we can also probably make ourselves less
vulnerable, but, you know, I just think consciousness, sentience,
self-awareness, like I think this might be the single greatest like moment in
evolution ever. And like, maybe this is, you know, the true beginning of life.
And we're just, we're the blue green algae, or we're like the single celled
organisms of something amazing. The universe awakens and this is it. Yeah. Well,
see, you're an incredible person. You're a fascinating mind. You should
definitely do, your friend Liv mentioned that you guys were thinking of maybe
talking. I would love it if you explored your mind in this kind of medium more
and more by doing a podcast with her or just in any kind of way. So you're an
awesome person. It's an honor to know you. It's an honor to get to sit down with
you late at night, which is like surreal. And I really enjoyed it. Thank you for
talking today. Yeah, no, I mean, huge honor. I feel very underqualified to be
here, but I'm a big fan. I've been listening to the podcast a lot and yeah, me
and Liv would appreciate any advice and help. And we're definitely gonna do
that, so. Yeah. Anytime, thank you.",497 90,"tagesschau de [y4L FrZJd8E].mp3.
Diese junge Frau zählt gerade mal 27 Jahre, aber für Kenner zählt sie bereits zu
den absoluten Ausnahmeerscheinungen im Musikgeschäft. Eigentlich heißt sie
Claire Boucher, aber die Pumpmusik mischt sie unter dem Namen Grimes auf. Sie
sei eine Mischung aus einer märchenhaften Elfe und einer außerirdischen, schrieb
ein Kritiker jüngst. Und dabei stammt Grimes schlicht und einfach aus Kanada und
schwärbte als Kind für, raten Sie, Britney Spears. Wie Millionen andere
Jugendliche auch natürlich, aber heute ist Grimes längst nicht mehr wie andere.
Sie produziert alles, was sie macht, selbst und das Ergebnis klingt aufregend
neu. Bis Sonntag gibt Grimes vier Konzerte in Deutschland, das erste davon heute
Abend in Berlin. Norbert Lübbers. Warte, haben wir angefangen? Oh, wir fangen
an! Oh, wir gehen! Oh, Jesus Christ! Okay, ähm. Da ist sie, Grimes,
Hoffnungsträgerin der Popwelt. In wenigen Stunden steht sie auf der Bühne. Aber
im Moment ist sie noch Claire Boucher, eine 27-Jährige aus Kanada, die mit ihren
Tänzern das richtige Outfit sucht. Gute Shorts sind wichtig. Und Socken, ein
paar saubere Socken. Ganz wichtig, Zähne putzen, bevor ich auf die Bühne gehe,
das wird sonst peinlich. Groß und gewaltig, das sind ihre Elektrohymnen. Alles
in Eigenregie. Grimes singt, schreibt, produziert und macht notfalls auch noch
die Farbkorrektur ihrer Musikvideos. Das ist meine Form von Kontrolle. Ich weiß
einfach, dass ich das alles selbst erreicht habe. Es wäre komisch, mit anderen
Musikern zu arbeiten. Ich kann manchmal halt auch ein kleines Arschloch sein.
Die haben wahrscheinlich auch keinen Bock auf mich. Alles, was sie für ihre
Musik braucht, ein Computer und die richtige Software. Gearbeitet wird im
Schlafzimmer.",498 91,"ollapalooza 2016 [sp3AMBGV4xI].mp3. I think I would
define what I'm doing as Grimes, you know, in an overarching way. It's just a, I
don't know, a really independent project. Like I oversee everything myself. I
produce and engineer and write everything myself and I do all the visual
artwork. So I don't know, I guess it's kind of like a one man show kind of
thing. You know, you're talking about a post-genre world. Actually, I really
love genre. I feel like kind of being fluid between genres and working with
genres is kind of awesome. It's like you don't really get post-genre without
genre to begin with. So with my last album I was like, you know, I want to make
some country music and I'd never tried before. And you know, I love that there's
a mold and a method and a long lineage that I can like learn from. I think
that's really awesome. Biggest musical inspiration would be Trent Reznor just
because, you know, he produced Pretty Hate Machine by himself. Or someone like
Kate Bush, you know, people who have done what I like to think that I'm doing. I
think the reason I self-produce everything is just that I see myself as a
producer. You know, originally way back in the day I was trying to find
vocalists because I don't think I was as good at singing as I am at producing.
But that's a little hard, especially when you're as controlling as I am. Because
I don't want to get someone to be like, OK, dedicate your whole life to my
project and do exactly what I say all the time. So I don't know. I feel like I'm
actually just a producer who has to sing because I can't find anyone to
basically work full time for me. Essential gear, a wireless microphone,
otherwise I'll twist my ankles. Something running Ableton and SP-404 Roland
samplers. Oh, and a TC Helicon looper pedal or else I'd be fucked. Well, I
illustrated the cover of my album. It was actually just a thing I'd started
randomly in a sketchbook. But basically I just started integrating colors. I'd
never really been colored before. I'd mostly just done line work.",485
92,"bsessed with Instinctive Self Expression [1YcYTdwEfoc].mp3. This is Claire
Boucher, otherwise known as Grimes. Can you even believe this unbelievable
badass? I feel like it's sort of a mark of our generation that no one really has
any purpose for doing anything creative and there just seems to be all this like
meaningless art and like I hate to contribute to that but I guess I do. I do
think there are a lot of smart pop songs. In fact, a lot of pop songs that would
be considered, you know, very vapid mainstream pop songs are very, very smart.
Grimes is ultimately a pop project. I consider pop to be just music that is
ultimately extremely gratifying. It's music that just seeks to hit the pleasure
center. And even though she claims to hate singing, I hate singing. she's
obviously a front woman when she gets on stage. But what she cares most about is
not the performing, it's the producing. But you know I'd constantly be getting
emails from like producers and stuff being like, I'd love to like work on some
tracks on your album. People just offering to do your job all the time and it's
just like infuriating. I mean even just to get to the point where I could like
produce my own record, like why else am I here? Like I don't want to be just
like the face of like this thing that I built, I want to be the person who built
it. And you can see her creating a clear distinction for herself between the
two. Producer Grimes is just Claire Boucher. But in order to perform she needs
to put on characters. When you're making a record and you're never talking to
anybody, you just start, oh I'm going to try to write in the voice of a, you
know like with a Harley Quinn kind of vibe, like just sort of this jokery, like
scary. I'm pretty much always pretending to be someone else when I'm singing. I
started for the first time writing in other people's voices. It was a huge door
for me when I first started trying to write music for other people. Because
suddenly you don't have to feel self-conscious. Lyrically it's also so much
easier. You're like, oh well this doesn't have to be something my parents are
going to hear and think, wow I can't believe you did that.",496 93,"Which is
actually huge, probably one of my biggest hindrances as an artist is like my
parents or grandparents being upset by my lyrics being, you know, not PG or too
weird or something. So she plays characters. Specifically a character, a pop
star named Grimes. And here you can see her play both parts. You can see her
going from a performer side to a producer side. She's really working the crowd.
She's getting ready to do the drop and... Where was it? Producer Grimes is
trying to figure it out. Oh, there it is. What happened? Oh, now she's Claire
Bruchet. Now she's Grimes again. And for the video Flesh Without Blood, she
created a whole bevy of characters. If you've seen the movie Looper, they're
like kind of like traveling through time. So they're like different iterations
of the same character over time. So if Ivy's like the really, really ancient one
and then like Screechy Bat is like the current one, then like they're traveling
through time to kill the Marie Antoinette version so she doesn't f*** things up.
Ivy is sort of like the demon, this is so embarrassing, leader of the album.
God, I can't say it out loud. That's really weird because Grimes is usually
totally unselfconscious about anything she says in interviews. I feel like
Justin Bieber is really underappreciated, I guess. He's pretty talented. And
tied for the most nominations. Yeah, yeah, no. It's a huge honor. It's very
exciting. My grandparents are stoked. Yeah. These are the symbols from the fifth
element on the four fingers. Like I would start a song with this, like I would
just go like. Like. You know what I mean? Yeah. And her lack of
self-consciousness comes simply from the fact that she does whatever feels
right. She never even intended to have a music career, it just happened because
it felt right. Were you always making music? Have you always done it kind of?
No, it's kind of, I started when I was maybe 22 or 23. Oh really? Yeah. That's
interesting. It's really weird, but this is my job. I love that. Did you play
any instruments as a kid? No, no.",479 94,"ading Festival 2012 Roland [GZ
3HtlSnOU].mp3. Okay Grimes, how are you? Pretty good, how are you? We're in your
tour bus. Yeah. Let's have a little look. So you've just played your set at
Reading Festival 2012, how did it go? I think it went pretty well, but I'm
apparently sick so I felt kind of sketchy myself, but like, I don't know, the
crowd was really responsive and stuff so that was good. And have you caught
anyone else here today? Have you been watching anyone or just getting some rest?
Just resting, but I'm going to see Azaelian Banks and Katie B are going to play.
Yeah. So those are the two bands I want to see. Nice. They're both playing here
this stage. Alright, sounds like it's going off. Yeah, so I don't even need to
leave, I can just stay here. Just stay here, nice. Yeah, we saw Green Day kind
of. How was that? It was kind of good, they played a lot of Dookie and like, I
was really into Dookie when I was a teenager and like, I'm near Brad, so like, I
don't really listen to Green Day anymore, I guess, you know, but it was sort of
nostalgic. Basket case though, right? Yeah. Classic. Yeah. So, I wanted to ask
you what your definition of punk is. Well, my definition of punk, I mean, it
totally, I know so many people that have totally different definitions of what
punk means. Like, I guess it's more of like an ideological sort of response to
things, like, I don't know how, I mean, there's obviously the musical, like, you
know, various musical ideas of what punk is, which is, you know, like three
chords and like yelling and like, you know, but. Classic stereotype.",406
95,"You know, I think it's, I think it's like just like an inherently political
and sort of like music oriented movement that is like, generally opposed to
conservatism and, I don't know, well, it's weird, like, it's hard to make grand
statements about punk, because I've met a lot of like totally sexist, like
asshole, alcoholic punks, and I've met a bunch of like straight edge, like, like
feminist punks, you know what I mean? So, but, you know, basically that's, you
know. Some people can take it the wrong way, I guess. I just think it's a
really, punk is a really broad term at this point. I just think there's been so
many different ideas of what punk is and like, it's very, you cannot sum it up.
Favourite punk band ever? Favourite punk band ever? Desert Island punk disc. I
don't know, like, I don't know what counts as punk anymore. Like, are the
Ramones punk? Like, I guess so. Yeah. I don't know. It's like, it's like Latigra
punk. Like, I don't know. Like, is that like, this is all these like different
like, like, I just feel like I'm not, I don't know. Favourite punk record? Is
Lady Gaga punk? No. I don't know. I'd have to think about that one. Yeah. Yeah.
So, we know you're from Canada. What's the main differences in the audience
between like, an English audience and a Canadian audience? I don't know. I don't
know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I
don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Do you notice any difference when you're
travelling, the crowds, like differing? I don't know. It really depends. I'd say
there's like, more of a difference between like, West Coast and East Coast
audiences than like, I don't know. British audiences are like, I mean, I've
mostly played festivals here, so it's really hard for me to say because most of
the shows I've played in England have been all ages. Yeah.",476 96,"And I'd say
there's more of a difference between like, all ages versus not all ages than
there are between like, English and like, North American audiences. But, you
know, like this crowd was really like, just loud and like, vocal and like,
people were screaming a lot on each other's shoulders and stuff. That doesn't
happen very much in Canada. Right. Because people in Canada are very reserved. A
bit more reserved, a bit more. Yeah. And I think people are more drunk earlier
in the day here. Right. Yeah, that happens. So, we know in New Orleans, someone
tried to steal your keyboard, right? Yeah. That was a great show actually. Do
you need us to fit an alarm system on the guy? No. No, the guys... You gonna
handle it? Yeah. I don't really play shows, I haven't played that many shows
where I'm like, in the audience these days. That was very much like, playing on
the floor with like, people behind me. With people around you. It was like, not
in like, a venue, you know. And do you think he was actually trying to steal it
or was he just caught up in the moment? I think he was trying to steal it, but
he was also clearly like, I was like, you're not gonna remember this moment.
Right. Like, his eyes were rolling back. Right. Like, he was just like, grabbing
my like, thing. And I was just like... His friends would be like, do you know
what you did last night at the show? Yeah. No, did I? He was actually a dick, he
peed on his girlfriend after the show and I tried to call her a cab because she
was like, puking outside. Shocking. Yeah, and then he was like, he's like, I'll
drive her home, like, get her. And I was like, dude, you're so drunk, you can't
drive your girlfriend home. And I got in like, a big fight with him. Oh, God.
Yeah, so he turned out to be just like, the worst person ever. That's not the
most romantic date of all time. No. So, you know, you're playing the Roland
Gaia, how's it working out for you? Um, I don't know, it's great.",492 97,"It's
little, that's the big difference. You like the small keyboard and just hands
on, like, we know you're using a lot of the kind of, the knobs and faders and
stuff. Yeah, it's good for like, my noise jam, my psych jams. Yeah, psych jams,
okay. Yeah. And you're using the cutoff kind of a lot, bringing it back in
and... Yeah, and then you like, bring the pitch like, and then it's like, a
little ADM or something. Nice, nice. So, um, what have you got left for the rest
of the year? Like, what's the kind of highlight coming up for you? There's so
much going on for you right now. Yeah. I'm trying to think, the highlight. I
don't know. I'm pretty excited to go to like, like, I'm doing like, the very
last stuff that I'm doing is really exciting. I'm doing like, Australia, New
Zealand, and then like, the Coachella cruise, which, that might be really weird,
but I think it'll be really fun. Because a bunch of my other friends who are
musicians are also playing that. And it'll just be like, being in the Bahamas
with like, I've never been on a cruise, I've never been to the Bahamas. That
sounds pretty exciting. And then I'm going to Mexico because I get off on New
Year's Eve and then Skrillex is playing, or sorry, I get off on Christmas Eve
and then Skrillex is playing in Mexico on New Year's Eve. And I want to go see
that show and I know a bunch of people that were on the Skrillex tour are going
to go to that show. So I think there'll be like, a slight reunion there and
that'll be really nice. Nice. I see you know all those guys. Yes, yeah. And I
mean, just like everyone who was on the train, including like, all the, like,
you know, everyone just got, was, has bonded a lot. Nice. So as far as
songwriting goes, how do you, we know you write songs really quickly. You've
said before that you write a song in a day. Normally it's like, start to finish
in a day. Is the process still the same? Do you go into the studio? You said
you've got better at production.",499 98,"Yeah, well, lately it's been a lot
more like, it's been taking longer because, I don't know, it's kind of like a
bike. Like, it's kind of like fixing a bike. Like, the more you know about
bikes, then like, all of a sudden you see all the problems with your bike. Like,
before I knew how to fix my bike, I would just ride my bike and just never
tighten the brakes or anything for like years. And then like the bike would
just, and then eventually the bike would just be broken and I'd be like, oh. But
then like, then like once I sort of figured out, like sort of learning about
like fixing bikes and all of a sudden I was like constantly having to like fix
my bike and like replace things and do stuff. And it's kind of like that now.
It's like, the more I know about production, the more it's just like, I don't
know, it probably takes me like three days to make a song now. And presumably,
the more you know about bikes, the more accessories you want to get for your
bike. Yeah, like the more you know about plugins. You want to get more toys.
Yeah. Yeah. So are you, I mean, like take us through that three day songwriting
stance. I mean, are you literally just going in and starting with a drum beat? I
usually start with a drum beat. It's usually like the first day I'll kind of
make like a layout. Yeah. And I'll want to produce like the whole thing. And
like now I'm really sort of like, because before it'd be like, I'll just do it
and like, we can fix it in mastering. We can, you know, we'll mix it after. But
now I'm very much like mixing it as I go and try to make it like as good as it
can be. Like as I'm, you know, because before there would be so much repairing,
like after the fact. So now I'm, and then like, then I'll probably do like a day
of like vocals. And then like a lot of times that'll lead to like changes in
structure in the song. And then I usually spend like a day like going back and
changing stuff. Right. And like reproducing things.",479 99,"ldrums Tour Diary

he's not with us right now. There was a fire next to the venue. And a giant
