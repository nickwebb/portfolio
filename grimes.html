we are becoming cyborgs. Like our brains are fundamentally changed. Everyone who
grew up with electronics, we are fundamentally different from previous, from
homo sapiens. I call us homo techno. I think we have evolved into homo techno,
which is like essentially a new species. Previous technologies, I mean, may have
even been more profound and moved us to a certain degree, but I think the
computers are what make us homo techno. I think this is what, it's a brain
augmentation. So it like allows for actual evolution. Like the computers
accelerate the degree to which all the other technologies can also be
accelerated. Would you classify yourself as a homo sapien or a homo techno?
Definitely homo techno. So you're one of the earliest of the species. I think
most of us are. The following is a conversation with Grimes, an artist,
musician, songwriter, producer, director, and a fascinating human being who
thinks a lot about both the history and the future of human civilization.
Studying the dark periods of our past to help form an optimistic vision of our
future. This is the Lux Friedman Podcast. To support it, please check out our
sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Grimes. Oh yeah, the
Cloudlifter, there you go. There you go. You know your stuff. Have you ever used
a Cloudlifter? Yeah, I actually, this microphone Cloudlifter is what Michael
Jackson used, so. No, really? Yeah, this is like Thriller and stuff. This mic
and the Cloudlifter? And that, yeah, it's an incredible microphone. It's very
flattering on vocals. I've used this a lot. It's great for demo vocals. It's
great in a room. Sometimes it's easier to record vocals if you're just in a room
and the music's playing and you just wanna feel it so it's not in the
headphones. And this mic is pretty directional, so I think it's a good mic for
just vibing out and just getting a real good vocal take. Just vibing, just in a
room. Anyway, this is the Michael Jackson, Quincy Jones microphone. I feel way
more badass now. All right, let's get in. You wanna just get into it? I guess
so. All right, one of your names, at least in this space and time, is C, like
the letter C. And you told me that C means a lot of things. It's the speed of
light. It's the render rate of the universe. It's yes in Spanish. It's the
crescent moon. And it happens to be my favorite programming language because it
basically runs the world, but it's also powerful, fast, and it's dangerous
because you can mess things up really bad with it because of all the pointers.
But anyway, which of these associations with the name C is the coolest to you? I
mean, to me, the coolest is the speed of light, obviously. Or the speed of
light, when I say render rate of the universe, I think I mean the speed of light
because essentially that's what we're rendering at. See, I think we'll know if
we're in a simulation if the speed of light changes because if they can improve
their render speed, then. That's already pretty good. It's already pretty good,
but if it improves, then we'll know, we can probably be like, okay, they've
updated or upgraded. Well, it's fast enough for us humans because it seems
immediate. There's no delay, there's no latency in terms of us humans on Earth
interacting with things. But if you're like intergalactic species operating on a
much larger scale, then you're gonna start noticing some weird stuff. Or if you
can operate in like around a black hole, then you're gonna start to see some
render issues. You can't go faster than the speed of light, correct? So it
really limits our ability or one's ability to travel space. Theoretically, you
can, you have wormholes. So there's nothing in general relativity that precludes
faster than the speed of light to travel, but it just seems you're gonna have to
do some really funky stuff with very heavy things that have like weirdnesses,
that have basically tears in space time. We don't know how to do that. Do
navigators know how to do it? Do navigators? Yeah. Folding space, basically
making wormholes. So the name C. Yes. Who are you? Do you think of yourself as
multiple people? Are you one person? Do you know, like in this morning, were you
a different person than you are tonight? We are, I should say, recording this
basically at midnight, which is awesome. Yes, thank you so much. I think I'm
about eight hours late. No, you're right on time. Good morning. This is the
beginning of a new day soon. Anyway, are you the same person you were in the
morning and the evening? Is there multiple people in there? Do you think of
yourself as one person or maybe you have no clue? Or are you just a giant
mystery to yourself? Okay, these are really intense questions, but. Let's go,
let's go. Because I asked this myself, like look in the mirror, who are you?
People tell you to just be yourself, but what does that even mean? I mean, I
think my personality changes with everyone I talk to. So I have a very
inconsistent personality. Yeah. Person to person, so the interaction, your
personality materializes. Or my mood, like I'll go from being like a
megalomaniac to being like, you know, just like a total hermit who is very shy.
So some combinatorial combination of your mood and the person you're interacting
with. Yeah, mood and people I'm interacting with. But I think everyone's like
that. Maybe not. Well, not everybody acknowledges it and able to introspect it.
Who brings out, what kind of person, what kind of mood brings out the best in
you as an artist and as a human? Can you introspect this? Like my best friends,
like people who I can, when I'm like super confident and I know that they're
gonna understand everything I'm saying, so like my best friends, then when I can
start being really funny, that's always my like peak mode. But it's like, yeah,
it takes a lot to get there. Let's talk about constraints. You've talked about
constraints and limits. Do those help you out as an artist or as a human being
or do they get in the way? Do you like the constraints? So in creating music, in
creating art, in living life, do you like the constraints that this world puts
on you? Or do you hate them? If constraints are moving, then you're good, right?
Like it's like as we are progressing with technology, we're changing the
constraints of like artistic creation. Making video and music and stuff is
getting a lot cheaper. There's constantly new technology and new software that's
making it faster and easier. We have so much more freedom than we had in the
70s. Like when Michael Jackson, when they recorded Thriller with this
microphone, like they had to use a mixing desk and all this stuff and like
probably even getting a studio is probably really expensive and you have to be a
really good singer and you have to know how to use like the mixing desk and
everything. And now I can just make, I've made a whole album on this computer. I
have a lot more freedom, but then I'm also constrained in different ways because
there's like literally millions more artists. It's like a much bigger playing
field. It's just like, I also, I didn't learn music. I'm not a natural musician.
So I don't know anything about actual music. I just know about like the
computer. So I'm really kind of just like messing around and like trying things
out. Well, yeah, I mean, but the nature of music is changing. So you're saying
you don't know actual music, what music is changing. Music is becoming, you've
talked about this, is becoming, it's like merging with technology. Yes. It's
becoming something more than just like the notes on a piano. It's becoming some
weird composition that requires engineering skills, programming skills, some
kind of human robot interaction skills, and still some of the same things that
Michael Jackson had, which is like a good ear for a good sense of taste of
what's good and not, the final thing, what is put together. Like you're allowed,
you're enabled, empowered with a laptop to layer stuff, to start like layering
insane amounts of stuff. And it's super easy to do that. I do think music
production is a really underrated art form. I feel like people really don't
appreciate it. When I look at publishing splits, the way that people like pay
producers and stuff, it's super, producers are just deeply underrated. So many
of the songs that are popular right now or for the last 20 years, part of the
reason they're popular is because the production is really interesting or really
sick or really cool. And it's like, I don't think listeners, people just don't
really understand what music production is. It's not, it's sort of like this
weird, discombobulated art form. It's not like a formal, because it's so new,
there isn't like a formal training path for it. It's mostly driven by like
autodidacts. Like it's like almost everyone I know who's good at production,
like I didn't go to music school or anything. They just taught themselves. Are
they mostly different? Like the music producers you know, is there some
commonalities that tie them together or are they all just different kinds of
weirdos? Because I just hung out with Rick Rubin. I don't know if you've- Yeah,
I mean, Rick Rubin is like literally one of the gods of music production. Like
he's one of the people who first, you know, who like made music production, you
know, made the production as important as the actual lyrics or the notes. But
the thing he does, which is interesting, I don't know if you can speak to that,
but just hanging out with him, he seems to just sit there in silence, close his
eyes and listen. It's like he almost does nothing. And that nothing somehow
gives you freedom to be the best version of yourself. So that's music production
somehow too, which is like encouraging you to do less, to simplify, to like push
towards minimalism. I mean, I guess, I mean, I work differently from Rick Rubin
because Rick Rubin produces for other artists, whereas like I mostly produce for
myself. So it's a very different situation. I also think Rick Rubin, he's in
that, I would say advanced category of producer where like you've like earned
your, you can have an engineer and stuff and people like do the stuff for you.
But I usually just like do stuff myself. So you're the engineer, the producer
and the artist. Yeah, I guess I would say I'm in the era, like the post Rick
Rubin era. Like I come from the kind of like Skrillex school of thought, which
is like where you are, yeah, the engineer, producer, artist. I mean, lately,
sometimes I'll work with a producer. Now I'm gently sort of delicately starting
to collaborate a bit more, but like I think I'm kind of from the, like the
whatever 2010s explosion of things where everything became available on the
computer and you kind of got this like lone wizard energy thing going. So you
embrace being the loneliness. Is the loneliness somehow an engine of creativity?
Like, so most of your stuff, most of your creative quote unquote genius in
quotes is in the privacy of your mind? Yes, well, it was, but here's the thing.
I was talking to Daniel Eck and he said, he's like most artists, they have about
10 years, like 10 good years. And then they usually stop making their like vital
shit. And I feel like I'm sort of like nearing the end of my 10 years on my own.
And- You have to become somebody else. Now I'm like, I'm in the process of
becoming somebody else and reinventing. When I work with other people, because
I've never worked with other people, I find that I make like, that I'm
exceptionally rejuvenated and making like some of the most vital work I've ever
made. So, because I think another human brain is like one of the best tools you
can possibly find. Like- It's a funny way to put it, I love it. It's like, if a
tool is like, you know, whatever HP plus one or like adds some like stats to
your character, like another human brain will like square it instead of just
like adding something. Double up the experience points. I love this. We should
also mention we're playing tavern music before this and which I love, which I
first, I think I- You had to stop the tavern music. Yeah, because it doesn't,
the audio. Okay, okay. But it makes- Yeah, it'll make the podcast annoying. Add
it in post, add it in post. No one will want to listen to the podcast. They
probably would, but it makes me, it reminds me like of a video game, like a
role-playing video game where you have experience points. There's something
really joyful about wandering places like Elder Scrolls, like Skyrim, just
exploring these landscapes in another world and then you get experience points
and you can work on different skills and somehow you progress in life. And I
don't know, it's simple. It doesn't have some of the messy complexities of life.
And there's usually a bad guy you can fight in Skyrim, it's dragons and so on.
I'm sure in Elden Ring, there's a bunch of monsters you can fight. I love that.
I feel like Elden Ring, I feel like this is a good analogy to music production
though, because it's like, I feel like the engineers and the people creating
these open worlds are, it's sort of like similar to people, to music producers,
whereas it's like this hidden archetype that like no one really understands what
they do and no one really knows who they are, but they're like, it's like the
artist engineer because it's like, it's both art and fairly complex engineering.
Well, you're saying they don't get enough credit. Aren't you kind of changing
that by becoming the person doing everything? Isn't the engineer? Well, I mean,
others have gone before me. I'm not, you know, there's like Timbaland and
Skrillex and there's all these people that are like, you know, very famous for
this. But I just think the general, I think people get confused about what it is
and just don't really know what it is per se. And it's just, when I see a song,
like when there's like a hit song, like I'm just trying to think of like, just
going for like even just a basic pop hit, like what's it, like Rules by Dua Lipa
or something. The production on that is actually like really crazy. I mean, the
song is also great, but it's like the production is exceptionally memorable.
Like, you know, and it's just like no one, I don't even know who produced that
song. It just like, isn't part of like the rhetoric of how we discuss the
creation of art. We just sort of like, don't consider the music producer.
Because I think the music producer used to be more just simply recording things.
Yeah, that's interesting. Cause when you think about movies, we talk about the
actor and the actresses, but we also talk about the director. Directors, yeah.
We don't talk about like that with the music as often. The Beatles music
producer was one of the first kind of, one of the first people sort of
introducing crazy sound design into pop music. I forget his name. He has the
same, I forget his name, but you know, like he was doing all the weird stuff,
like dropping pianos and like, yeah. Oh, to get the, yeah, yeah, yeah. To get
the sound, to get the authentic sound. What about lyrics? You think those, where
did they fit into how important they are? I was heartbroken to learn that Elvis
didn't write his songs. I was very mad. A lot of people don't write their songs.
I understand this, but. But here's the thing. I feel like there's this desire
for authenticity. I used to be like really mad when like people wouldn't write
or produce their music. And I'd be like, that's fake. And then I realized
there's all this like weird bitterness and like agroness in art about
authenticity. But I had this kind of like weird realization recently where I
started thinking that like art is sort of a decentralized collective thing. Like
art is kind of a conversation with all the artists that have ever lived before
you, you know? Like it's like, you're really just sort of, it's not like
anyone's reinventing the wheel here. Like you're kind of just taking, you know,
thousands of years of art and like running it through your own little algorithm
and then like making, you're like your interpretation of it. You just join the
conversation with all the other artists that came before. It's such a beautiful
way to look at it. Like, and it's like, I feel like everyone's always like,
there's always copyright and IP and this and that or authenticity. And it's just
like, I think we need to stop seeing this as this like egotistical thing of
like, oh, the creative genius, the lone creative genius or this or that. Because
it's like, I think art shouldn't be about that. I think art is something that
sort of brings humanity together. And it's also, art is also kind of the
collective memory of humans. Like we don't give a fuck about whatever ancient
Egypt, like how much grain got sent that day and sending the records and like,
you know, like who went where and how many shields needed to be produced for
this. Like we just remember their art. And it's like, you know, it's like in our
day-to-day life, there's all this stuff that seems more important than art
because it helps us function and survive. But when all this is gone, like the
only thing that's really gonna be left is the art, the technology will be
obsolete. That's so fascinating. Like the humans will be dead. That is true. A
good compression of human history is the art we've generated across the
different centuries, the different millennia. So when the aliens come. When the
aliens come, they're gonna find the hieroglyphics and the pyramids. I mean, art
could be broadly defined. They might find like the engineering marvels, the
bridges, the rockets, the- I guess I sort of classify though. Architecture is
art. Yes. I consider engineering in those formats to be art, for sure. It sucks
that like digital art is easier to delete. So if there's an apocalypse, a
nuclear war that can disappear. Yes. And the physical, there's something still
valuable about the physical manifestation of art. That's, that sucks that like
music, for example, has to be played by somebody. Yeah, I mean, I do think we
should do have a foundation type situation where we like, you know how we have
like seed banks up in the North and stuff? Yeah. Like we should probably have
like a solar powered or geothermal little bunker that like has all the, all
human knowledge. You mentioned Daniel Hayek and Spotify. What do you think about
that as an artist? What's Spotify? Is that empowering? I get to me Spotify sort
of as a consumer is super exciting. It makes it easy for me to access music from
all kinds of artists, get to explore all kinds of music, make it super easy to
sort of curate my own playlist and have fun with all that. It was so liberating
to let go. You know, I used to collect, you know, albums and CDs and so on,
like, like, like horde albums. Yeah. Like they matter. But the reality you can,
you know, that was really liberating that I could let go of that and letting go
of the albums you're kind of collecting allows you to find new music, exploring
new artists and all that kind of stuff. But I know from a perspective of an
artist that could be, like you mentioned, competition could be a kind of
constraint because there's more and more and more artists on the platform. I
think it's better that there's more artists. I mean, again, this might be
propaganda because this is all from a conversation with Daniel Ek. So this could
easily be propaganda. Like- We're all a victim of somebody's propaganda. So
let's just accept this. But Daniel Ek was telling me that, you know, at the,
cause I, you know, when, when I met him, I like, I was, I came in all furious
about Spotify and like I grilled him super hard. So I've got his, his answers
here. But he was saying like at the sort of peak of the CD industry, there was
like 20,000 artists making millions and millions of dollars. Like there was just
like a very tiny kind of 1%. And Spotify has kind of democratized the industry
because now I think he said there's about a million artists making a good living
from Spotify. And when I heard that, I was like, honestly, I would rather make
less money and have just like a decent living than, and have more artists be
able to have that. Even though I like, I wish it could include everyone, but-
Yeah, that's really hard to argue with. YouTube is the same. Is YouTube's
mission, they want to basically have as many creators as possible and make a
living, some kind of living. Yeah. And that, that's so hard to argue with. It's
so hard. But I think there's better ways to do it. My manager, I actually wish
he was here. I like, I would have brought him up. My manager is building an app
that can manage you. So it'll like help you organize your percentages and get
your publishing and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. So you can take out all the
middlemen, so you can have a much bigger, it'll just like automate it. So you
can get- So automate the manager? Automate, automate, management, publishing,
like, and legal, it can read, the app he's building can read your contract and
like tell you about it. Because one of the issues with music right now, it's not
that we're not getting paid enough, but it's that the art industry is filled
with middlemen because artists are not good at business. And, you know, from the
beginning, like Frank Sinatra, it's all mob stuff. Like it's the music industry,
you know, is run by business people, not the artists. And the artists really get
very small cuts of like what they make. And so I think part of the reason I'm a
technocrat, which I mean, your fans are gonna be technocrats, so no one's,
they're not gonna be mad at me about this, but like my fans hate it when I say
this kind of thing, or the general public. They don't like technocrats. They
don't like technocrats. Like when I watched Battle Angel Alita, and they were
like the Martian technocracy, and I was like, yeah, Martian technocracy. And
then they were like, and they're evil. And I was like, ooh, okay. I was like,
cause Martian technocracy sounds sick to me. Yeah, so your intuition as
technocrats would create some kind of beautiful world. For example, what my
manager's working on, if you can create an app that removes the need for a
lawyer, and then you could have a smart contracts on the blockchain, removes the
need for like management and organizing all this stuff, like can read your stuff
and explain it to you, can collect your royalties, you know, like then the small
amounts, the amount of money that you're getting from Spotify actually means a
lot more and goes a lot farther. It can remove some of the bureaucracy, some of
the inefficiencies that make life not as great as it could be. Yeah, I think the
issue isn't that there's not enough. Like the issue is that there's
inefficiency. And I'm really into this positive sum mindset, you know, the
win-win mindset of like, instead of, you know, fighting over the scraps, how do
we make the, or worrying about scarcity, like instead of a scarcity mindset, why
don't we just increase the efficiency? And, you know, in that way. Expand the
size of the pie. Let me ask you about experimentation. So you said, which is
beautiful, being a musician is like having a conversation with all those that
came before you. How much of creating music is like kind of having that
conversation, trying to fit into the cultural trends, and how much of it is like
trying to, as much as possible, be an outsider and come up with something
totally new? It's like when you're thinking, when you're experimenting, are you
trying to be totally different, totally weird? Are you trying to fit in? Man,
this is so hard, because I feel like I'm kind of in the process of semi-retiring
from music. So this is like my old brain. Yeah, bring it from like the shelf,
put it on the table for a couple of minutes. We'll just poke it. I think it's a
bit of both, because I think forcing yourself to engage with new music, it's
really great for neuroplasticity. I think as people, part of the reason music is
marketed at young people is because young people are very neuroplastic. So if
you're 16 to like 23 or whatever, it's gonna be really easy for you to love new
music. And if you're older than that, it gets harder and harder and harder. And
I think one of the beautiful things about being a musician is I just constantly
force myself to listen to new music. And I think it keeps my brain really
plastic. And I think this is a really good exercise. I just think everyone
should do this. You listen to new music and you hate it, I think you should just
keep, force yourself to like, okay, well, why do people like it? And like, make
your brain form new neural pathways and be more open to change. That's really
brilliant, actually. Sorry to interrupt, but like that exercise is really
amazing to sort of embrace change, embrace sort of practice neuroplasticity.
Because like, that's one of the things, you fall in love with a certain band and
you just kind of stay with that for the rest of your life and then you never
understand the modern music. That's a really good exercise. Most of the
streaming on Spotify is like classic rock and stuff. Like new music makes up a
very small chunk of what is played on Spotify. And I think this is like not a
good sign for us as a species. I think, yeah. So it's a good measure of the
species open-mindedness to change is how often you listen to new music. Yeah.
The brain, let's put the music brain back on the shelf. I gotta pull out the
futurist brain for a second. In what wild ways do you think the future, say in
like 30 years, maybe 50 years, maybe a hundred years will be different from like
from our current way of life on earth? We can talk about augmented reality,
virtual reality, maybe robots, maybe space travel, maybe video games, maybe
generic engineering. I can keep going. Cyborgs, aliens, world wars, maybe
destructive nuclear wars, good and bad. When you think about the future, what
are you imagining? What's the weirdest and the wildest it could be? Have you
read Surface Detail by Ian Banks? Surface Detail is my favorite depiction of a,
oh wow, you have to read this book. It's literally the greatest science fiction
book possibly ever written. Ian Banks is the man, yeah, for sure. What have you
read? Just the Player of Games. I read that titles can't be copyrighted so you
can just steal them. And I was like, Player of Games, sick. Nice. Yeah, so you
can name your album. Like I always wanted to- Romeo and Juliet or something? I
always wanted to name an album War and Peace. Nice. Like that would be- That is
a good, that's a good, when have I heard that before? You can do that, like you
could do that. Also things that are in the public domain. For people who have no
clue, you do have a song called Player of Games. Yes, oh yeah. So Ian Banks'
Surface Detail is in my opinion, the best future that I've ever read about or
heard about in science fiction. Basically there's the relationship with super
intelligence, like artificial super intelligence is just, it's like great. I
wanna credit the person who coined this term because I love this term. And I
feel like young women don't get enough credit in. Yeah, so if you go to Protopia
Futures on Instagram, what is her name? Personalized Donor Experience at Scale
or Ad Power Donor Experience. Monica Bielskite, I'm saying that wrong. And I'm
probably butchering this a bit, but Protopia is sort of, if Utopia is
unattainable, Protopia is sort of like, you know. Wow, that's an awesome
Instagram, Protopia Futures. A great, a future that is as good as we can get.
The future, positive future. AI, is this a centralized AI in Surface Detail or
is it distributed? What kind of AI is it? They mostly exist as giant super
ships, sort of like the Guild ships in Dune. They're these giant ships that kind
of move people around and the ships are sentient and they can talk to all the
passengers. And I mean, there's a lot of different types of AI in the Banksyian
future, but in the opening scene of Surface Detail, there's this place called
the Culture and the Culture is basically a Protopian future. And a Protopian
future, I think, is like a future that is like, obviously it's not Utopia, it's
not perfect. Striving for Utopia, I think, feels hopeless and is sort of like,
maybe not the best terminology to be using. So it's a pretty good place. Mostly,
super intelligence and biological beings exist fairly in harmony. There's not
too much war. There's as close to equality as you can get. It's approximately a
good future. There's really awesome stuff. And in the opening scene, this girl,
she's born as a sex slave outside of the culture. So she's in a society that
doesn't adhere to the cultural values. She tries to kill the guy who is her
master, but he kills her. But unbeknownst to her, when she was traveling on a
ship through the culture with him one day, a ship put a neural lace in her head.
And neural lace is sort of like, it's basically a neural link. Because life
imitates art. It does indeed. It does indeed. So she wakes up and the opening
scene is her memory has been uploaded by this neural lace when she's been
killed. And now she gets to choose a new body. And this AI is interfacing with
her recorded memory in her neural lace and helping her and being like, hello,
you're dead. But because you had a neural lace, your memory's uploaded. Do you
want to choose a new body? And you're going to be born here in the culture and
start a new life. Which is just, that's the best part. Which is just, that's the
opening. It's so sick. And the ship is the super intelligence. All the ships are
kind of super intelligence. But they still want to preserve a kind of rich,
fulfilling experience for the humans. Yeah, they're friends with the humans. And
then there's a bunch of ships that don't want to exist with biological beings,
but they just have their own place way over there. But they don't, they just do
their own thing. They're not necessarily. So it's a pretty, this Portopian
existence is pretty peaceful. Yeah, I mean, and then for example, one of the
main fights in the book is, they're fighting, there's these artificial hells.
And people don't think it's ethical to have artificial hell. Like basically when
people do crime, they get sent, like when they die, their memory gets sent to an
artificial hell and they're eternally tortured. And so, and then the way that
society is deciding whether or not to have the artificial hell is that they're
having these simulated, they're having like a simulated war. So instead of
actual blood, people are basically essentially fighting in a video game to
choose the outcome of this. But they're still experiencing the suffering? Or in
this artificial hell or no? Can you experience stuff or? So the artificial hell
sucks. And a lot of people in the culture want to get rid of the artificial
hell. There's a simulated wars, are they happening in the artificial hell? No,
the simulated wars are happening outside of the artificial hell. Between the
political factions who are, so this political faction says, we should have
simulated hell to deter crime. And this political faction is saying, no,
stimulated hell is unethical. And so instead of like having, blowing each other
up with nukes, they're having like a giant Fortnite battle to decide this.
Which, to me that's pro-topia. That's like, okay, we can have war without death.
I don't think there should be simulated hells. I think that is definitely one of
the ways in which technology could go very, very, very, very wrong. So almost
punishing people in a digital space or something like that? Yeah, like torturing
people's memories. So either as a deterrent, like if you committed a crime, but
also just for personal pleasure, if there's some sick, demented humans in this
world. Dan Carlin actually has this episode of Hardcore History on painful
attainment. That episode is fucked. It's dark, because he kind of goes through
human history and says like, we as humans seem to enjoy, secretly enjoy, or used
to be openly enjoy, sort of the torture and the death, watching the death and
torture of other humans. I do think if people were consenting, we should be
allowed to have gladiatorial matches. But consent is hard to achieve in those
situations. It always starts getting slippery. Like it could be also forced
consent. Like it starts getting weird. There's way too much excitement. Like
this is what he highlights. There's something about human nature that wants to
see that violence. And it's really dark. And you hope that we can sort of
overcome that aspect of human nature, but that's still within us somewhere.
Well, I think that's what we're doing right now. I have this theory that what is
very important about the current moment is that all of evolution has been
survival of the fittest up until now. And at some point, the lines are kind of
fuzzy, but in the recent past, or maybe even just right now, we're getting to
this point where we can choose intelligent design. Like we, probably since like
the integration of the iPhone, like we are becoming cyborgs. Like our brains are
fundamentally changed. Everyone who grew up with electronics, we are
fundamentally different from previous, from Homo sapiens. I call us Homo techno.
I think we have evolved into Homo techno, which is like essentially a new
species. Like if you look at the way, if you took an MRI of my brain and you
took an MRI of like a medieval brain, I think it would be very different the way
that it has evolved. Do you think when historians look back at this time,
they'll see like this was a fundamental shift in what a human being is? I think,
I do not think we are still Homo sapiens. I believe we are Homo techno. And I
think we have evolved. And I think right now, the way we are evolving, we can
choose how we do that. And I think we were being very reckless about how we're
doing that. Like we're just having social media, but I think this idea that like
this is a time to choose intelligent design should be taken very seriously. It
like now is the moment to reprogram the human computer. You know, it's like, if
you go blind, your visual cortex will get taken over with other functions. We
can choose our own evolution. We can change the way our brains work. And so we
actually have a huge responsibility to do that. And I think, I'm not sure who
should be responsible for that, but there's definitely not adequate education.
We're being inundated with all this technology that is fundamentally changing
the physical structure of our brains. And we are not adequately responding to
that to choose how we wanna evolve. And we could evolve, we could be really
whatever we want. And I think this is a really important time. And I think if we
choose correctly and we choose wisely, consciousness could exist for a very long
time and integration with AI could be extremely positive. And I don't think
enough people are focusing on this specific situation. Do you think we might
irreversibly screw things up if we get things wrong now? The flip side of that,
it seems humans are pretty adaptive. So maybe the way we figure things out is by
screwing it up. Like social media, over a generation, we'll see the negative
effects of social media and then we build new social medias and we just keep
improving stuff. And then we learn the failure from the failures of the past.
Because humans seem to be really adaptive. On the flip side, we can get it wrong
in a way where literally we create weapons of war or increase hate past a
certain threshold and we really do a lot of damage. I mean, I think we're
optimized to notice the negative things, but I would actually say, one of the
things that I think people aren't noticing is if you look at Silicon Valley and
you look at whatever, the technocracy, what's been happening there, when Silicon
Valley started, it was all just Facebook and all this for-profit crap that
really wasn't particular. I guess it was useful, but it was, it's sort of just
like whatever. But now you see lab-grown meat, like compostable or
biodegradable, single-use cutlery or meditation apps. I think we are actually
evolving and changing and technology is changing. I think there just maybe,
there isn't quite enough education about that. And also, I don't know if there's
quite enough incentive for it because I think the way capitalism works, what we
define as profit, we're also working on an old model of what we define as
profit. I really think if we changed the idea of profit to include social good,
you can have economic profit, social good, also counting as profit, would
incentivize things that are more useful and more whatever spiritual technology
like positive technology or things that help reprogram a human computer in a
good way or things that help us intelligently design our new brains. Yeah,
there's no reason why within the framework of capitalism, the word profit or the
idea of profit can't also incorporate the well-being of a human being. So like
long-term well-being, long-term happiness. Or even, for example, we were talking
about motherhood. Part of the reason I'm so late is because I had to get the
baby to bed. And it's like, I keep thinking about motherhood, how under
capitalism, it's like this extremely essential job that is very difficult, that
is not compensated. And we sort of like value things by how much we compensate
them. And so we really devalue motherhood in our society and pretty much all
societies. Like capitalism does not recognize motherhood. It's just a job that
you're supposed to do for free. But I feel like producing great humans should be
seen as profit under capitalism. Like that's like a huge social good. Like every
awesome human that gets made adds so much to the world. So like if that was
integrated into the profit structure, then, you know, and if we potentially
found a way to compensate motherhood. So come up with a compensation that's much
broader than just money. Or it could just be money. Like what if you just made,
I don't know, but I don't know how you'd pay for that. Like, I mean, that's
where you start getting into. Reallocation of resources that people get upset
over. Well, what if we made like a motherhood Dow? Yeah, yeah. You know, and,
you know, used it to fund like single mothers, like, you know, pay for making
babies. So, I mean, if you create and put beautiful things onto the world, that
could be companies, that can be bridges, that could be art, that could be a lot
of things, and that could be children, which are- Or education or- Anything that
should be valued by society. And that should be somehow incorporated into the
framework of what, as a market, of what, like, if you contribute children to
this world, that should be valued and respected and sort of celebrated, like,
proportional to what it is, which is, it's the thing that fuels human
civilization. Yeah, like I can- It's kind of important. I feel like everyone's
always saying, I mean, I think we're in very different social spheres, but
everyone's always saying like dismantle capitalism. And I'm like, well, okay,
well, I don't think the government should own everything. Like, I don't think we
should not have private ownership. Like, that's scary. You know, like that
starts getting into weird stuff and just sort of like, I feel there's almost no
way to do that without a police state, you know? But obviously capitalism has
some major flaws. And I think actually Mac showed me this idea called social
capitalism, which is a form of capitalism that just like considers social good
to be also profit. Like, you know, it's like right now companies need to, you're
supposed to grow every quarter or whatever to like show that you're functioning
well, but it's like, okay, well, what if you kept the same amount of profit?
You're still in the green, but then you have also all this social good. Like, do
you really need all this extra economic growth or could you add this social good
and that counts? And, you know, I don't know if I am not an economist. I have no
idea how this could be achieved, but- I don't think economists know how anything
could be achieved either, but they pretend. They construct a model and they go
on TV shows and sound like an expert. That's the definition of an economist. How
did being a mother, becoming a mother change you as a human being, would you
say? Man, I think it kind of changed everything and it's still changing me a
lot. It's actually changing me more right now in this moment than it was before.
Like today? Like this- Just like in the most recent months and stuff. Can you
elucidate that how, like when you wake up in the morning and you look at
yourself, it's again, who are you? How have you become different, would you say?
I think it's just really reorienting my priorities. And at first I was really
fighting against that because I somehow felt it was like a failure of feminism
or something. I felt like it was bad if my kids started mattering more than my
work. And then more recently I started sort of analyzing that thought in myself
and being like, that's also kind of a construct. It's like we've just devalued
motherhood so much in our culture that I feel guilty for caring about my kids
more than I care about my work. So feminism includes breaking out of whatever
the construct is. So it's continually breaking, it's like freedom empower you to
be free. And that means- But it also, but like being a mother, like I'm so much
more creative. Like I cannot believe the massive amount of brain growth that I
have. Why do you think that is? Just because like the stakes are higher somehow?
I think it's like, it's just so trippy watching consciousness emerge. It's like
going on a crazy journey or something. It's like the craziest science fiction
novel you could ever read. It's just so crazy watching consciousness come into
being. And then at the same time, like you're forced to value your time so much.
Like when I have creative time now, it's so sacred. I need to like be really
fricking on it. But the other thing is that I used to just be like a cynic and I
used to just wanna, like my last album was called Misanthropocene and it was
like this like, it was like a study in villainy. Or like it was like, well, what
if we have, instead of the old gods, we have like new gods and it's like
misanthropocene is like misanthrope like and anthropocene, which is like the,
like in she's the goddess of climate change or whatever. And she's like
destroying the world. And it was just like, it was like dark and it was like a
study in villainy. And it was sort of just like, like I used to like have no
problem just making cynical, angry, scary art. And not that there's anything
wrong with that, but I think having kids just makes you such an optimist. It
just inherently makes you wanna be an optimist so bad that like I feel like I'm
more of a responsibility to make more optimistic things. And I get a lot of shit
for it because everyone's like, oh, you're so privileged. Stop talking about
like pie in the sky, stupid concepts and focus on like the now. But it's like, I
think if we don't ideate about futures that could be good, we won't be able to
get them. If everything is Blade Runner, then we're gonna end up with Blade
Runner. It's like, as we said earlier, life imitates art. Like life really does
imitate art. And so we really need more protopian or utopian art. I think this
is incredibly essential for the future of humanity. And I think the current
discourse where that's seen as a thinking about protopia or utopia is seen as a
dismissal of the problems that we currently have. I think that is an incorrect
mindset. And like having kids just makes me want to imagine amazing futures that
like maybe I won't be able to build, but they will be able to build if they want
to. Yeah, it does seem like ideation is a precursor to creation. So you have to
imagine it in order to be able to build it. And there is a sad thing about human
nature that they somehow a cynical view of the world is seen as a insightful
view. Cynicism is often confused for insight, which is sad to see. And optimism
is confused for naivete. Yes, yes. Like you don't, you're blinded by your, maybe
your privilege or whatever. You're blinded by something, but you're certainly
blinded. That's sad. That's sad to see because it seems like the optimists are
the ones that create our future. They're the ones that build. In order to build
the crazy thing, you have to be optimistic. You have to be either stupid or
excited or passionate or mad enough to actually believe that it can be built.
And those are the people that built it. My favorite quote of all time is from
Star Wars Episode VIII, which I know everyone hates. Do you like Star Wars
Episode VIII? No, I probably would say I would probably hate it, yeah. I don't
have strong feelings about it. Let me backtrack. I don't have strong feelings
about Star Wars. I just wanna- I'm a Tolkien person. I'm more into dragons and
orcs and ogres. Yeah, I mean, Tolkien forever. I really wanna have one more son
and call him, I thought Tau Techno Tolkien would be cool. That's a lot of Ts, I
like it. Yeah, and Tau is 6282 pi. Yeah, Tau Techno, yeah, yeah, yeah. And then
techno is obviously the best genre of music, but also like technocracy. It just
sounds really good. Yeah, that's right. Techno Tolkien, Tau Techno Tolkien.
That's a good, that's a- Tau Techno Tolkien, but Star Wars Episode VIII, I know
a lot of people have issues with it. Personally, on the record, I think it's the
best Star Wars film. Starting trouble today. Yeah. So what- And, but don't kill
what you hate, save what you love. Don't kill what you hate. Don't kill what you
hate, save what you love. And I think we're in a society right now, we're in a
diagnosis mode. We're just diagnosing and diagnosing and diagnosing. And we're
trying to kill what we hate, and we're not trying to save what we love enough.
And it's, there's this Buckminster Fuller quote, which I'm gonna butcher,
because I don't remember it correctly, but it's something along the lines of,
don't like try to destroy the old bad models, render them obsolete with better
models. Maybe we don't need to destroy the oil industry. Maybe we just create a
new, great new battery technology and sustainable transport, and just make it
economically unreasonable to still continue to rely on fossil fuels. It's like,
don't kill what you hate, save what you love. Like make new things and just
render the old things unusable. It's like if the college debt is so bad, and
universities are so expensive, and this, I feel like education is becoming
obsolete. I feel like we could completely revolutionize education and we could
make it free. And it's like, you look at JSTOR, and you have to pay to get all
the studies and everything. What if we created a Dow that bought JSTOR, or we
created a Dow that was funding studies, and those studies were open source, or
free for everyone? And what if we just open sourced education and decentralized
education and made it free, and all research was on the internet, and all the
outcomes of studies are on the internet, and no one has student debt, and you
just take tests when you apply for a job, and if you're qualified, then you can
work there. This is just like, I don't know how anything works, I'm just
randomly ranting, but. I like the humility. You gotta think from just basic
first principles, like what is the problem, what's broken, what are some ideas,
that's it. And get excited about those ideas, and share your excitement, and
don't tear each other down. It's just when you kill things, you often end up
killing yourself. Like war is not a one-sided, like you're not gonna go in and
just kill them, like you're gonna get stabbed. And I think when I talk about
this nexus point of that we're in this point in society where we're switching to
intelligent design, I think part of our switch to intelligent design is that we
need to choose nonviolence. Like I think we can choose to start, I don't think
we can eradicate violence from our species, because I think we need it a little
bit, but I think we can choose to really reorient our primitive brains that are
fighting over scarcity, that are so attack-oriented, and move into, we can
optimize for creativity and building. Yeah, it's interesting to think how that
happens. Some of it is just education, some of it is living life and
introspecting your own mind, and trying to live up to the better angels of your
nature for each one of us, all those kinds of things at scale. That's how we can
sort of start to minimize the amount of destructive war in our world. And
that's, to me, I probably hear the same, technology is a really promising way to
do that. Social media should be a really promising way to do that. It's a way we
connect. For the most part, I really enjoy social media. I just ignore all the
negative stuff. I don't engage with any of the negative stuff, just not even by
blocking or any of that kind of stuff, but just not letting it enter my mind.
When somebody says something negative, I see it, I immediately think positive
thoughts about them, and I just forget they exist. After that, just move on,
because that negative energy, if I return the negative energy, they're going to
get excited in a negative way right back, and it's just this kind of vicious
cycle. But you would think technology would assist us in this process of letting
go, of not taking things personally, of not engaging in the negativity, but
unfortunately, social media profits from the negativity, so the current models.
Social media is like a gun. You should take a course before you use it. It's
like, this is what I mean when I say reprogram the human computer. In school,
you should learn about how social media optimizes to raise your cortisol levels
and make you angry and crazy and stressed, and you should learn how to have
hygiene about how you use social media. Choose not to focus on the negative
stuff. I don't know, I'm not sure social media should, I guess it should exist,
I'm not sure. I mean, we're in the messy, it's the experimental phase. Like,
we're working it out. I don't even know, when you say social media, I don't know
what that even means. We're in the very early days. I think social media is just
basic human connection in the digital realm, and that, I think it should exist,
but there's so many ways to do it in a bad way. There's so many ways to do it in
a good way. There's all discussions of all the same human rights. We talk about
freedom of speech. We talk about sort of violence in the space of digital media.
We talk about hate speech. We talk about all these things that we had to figure
out back in the day in the physical space. We're now figuring out in the digital
space, and it's like baby stages. When the printing press came out, it was like
pure chaos for a minute. You know, it's like when you inject, when there's a
massive information injection into the general population, there's just gonna
be, I feel like the printing press, I don't have the years, but it was like
printing press came out, shit got really fucking bad for a minute, but then we
got the enlightenment. And so it's like, I think we're in, this is like the
second coming of the printing press. We're probably gonna have some shitty times
for a minute, and then we're gonna have recalibrate to have a better
understanding of how we consume media and how we deliver media. Speaking of
programming the human computer, you mentioned Baby X. So there's this young
consciousness coming to be, came from a cell, like that whole thing doesn't even
make sense. It came from DNA. Yeah. And that this is baby computer, it is just
like grows and grows and grows and grows. And now there's a conscious being with
extremely impressive cognitive capabilities with- Have you met him? Yes, yeah.
Yeah. He's actually really smart. He's really smart. Yeah. He's weird. Yeah. Or
baby. I haven't- I don't know a lot of other babies, but he seems really smart.
I don't hang out with babies often, but this baby was very impressive. He does a
lot of pranks and stuff. Oh, so he's like- Like give you treatment, take it away
and laugh, like stuff like that. So he's like a chess player. So here's a
cognitive, there's a computer being programmed. So he's taking in the
environment, interacting with a specific set of humans. How would you, first of
all, what is it? Let me ask. I want to ask how do you program this computer? And
also how do you make sense of that there's a conscious being right there that
wasn't there before? It's given me a lot of crisis thoughts. I'm thinking really
hard. I think that's part of the reason. It's like I'm struggling to focus on
art and stuff right now because baby X is becoming conscious and it's just
reorienting my brain. My brain is suddenly totally shifting of like, oh shit,
the way we raise children. I hate all the baby books and everything. I hate
them. Like, oh, the art is so bad. And all this stuff, everything about all the
aesthetics. I'm just like, ah, this is so- The programming languages we're using
to program these baby computers isn't good. Yeah, I'm thinking, not that I have
good answers or know what to do, but I'm just thinking really, really hard about
it. We recently watched Totoro with him, Studio Ghibli. And it's just like a
fantastic film. And he responded to, I know you're not supposed to show baby
screens too much, but I think it's the most sort of like, I feel like it's the
highest art baby content. Like it really speaks, there's almost no talking in
it. It's really simple. All the dialogue is super, super, super simple. And it's
like a one to three-year-old can like really connect with it. Like it feels like
it's almost aimed at like a one to three-year-old, but it's like great art and
it's so imaginative and it's so beautiful. And like the first time I showed it
to him, he was just like so invested in it, unlike anything else I'd ever shown
him. Like he was just like crying when they cried, laughing when they laughed,
like just like having this rollercoaster of like emotions. And he learned a
bunch of words. Like he was, and he started saying Totoro and started just
saying all this stuff after watching Totoro. And he wants to watch it all the
time. And I was like, man, why isn't there an industry of this? Like why aren't
our best artists focusing on making art for the birth of consciousness? Like,
and that's one of the things I've been thinking I really want to start doing.
You know, I don't want to speak before I do things too much, but like I'm just
like ages one to three, like we should be putting so much effort into that. And
the other thing about Totoro is it's like, it's like better for the environment
because adults love Totoro. It's such good art that everyone loves it. Like I
still have all my old Totoro merch from when I was a kid. Like I literally have
the most ragged old Totoro merch. Like everybody loves it. Everybody keeps it.
It's like, why does the art we have for babies need to suck and be not
accessible to adults and then just be thrown out when, you know, they age out of
it? Like, it's like, I don't know. I don't have like a fully formed thought
here, but this is just something I've been thinking about a lot is like, how do
we have more Totoro-esque content? Like, how do we have more content like this
that like is universal and everybody loves, but is like really geared to an
emerging consciousness? Emerging consciousness. In the first like three years of
life that so much turmoil, so much evolution of mind is happening. It seems like
a crucial time. Would you say to make it not suck, do you think of basically
treating a child like they have the capacity to have the brilliance of an adult
or even beyond that? Is that how you think of that mind? No, because they still,
they like it when you talk weird and stuff. Like they respond better to, because
even they can imitate better when your voice is higher like people say like, oh,
don't do baby talk. But it's like when your voice is higher, it's closer to
something they can imitate. So they like, like the baby talk actually kind of
works. Like it helps them learn to communicate. I found it to be more effective
with learning words and stuff. But like, you're not speaking down to them. Like,
do they have the capacity to understand really difficult concepts just in a very
different way, like an emotional intelligence about something deep within? Oh
yeah, no, like if X hurts, like if X bites me really hard and I'm like, ow. Like
he gets, he's sad. He's like sad if he hurts me by accident. Which he's huge, so
he hurts me a lot by accident. Yeah, that's so interesting that that mind
emerges and he and children don't really have a memory of that time. So we can't
even have a conversation with them about it. So much stuff. Thank God they don't
have a memory of this time because like, think about like, I mean, with our
youngest baby, like it's like, I'm like, have you read the sci-fi short story, I
Have No Mouth But I Must Scream? Good title, no. Oh man, I mean, you should read
that. I Have No Mouth But I Must Scream. I hate getting into this Roko's
Basilisk shit. It's kind of a story about like an AI that's like torturing
someone in eternity and they have like no body. The way they describe it, it
sort of sounds like what it feels like, like being a baby, like you're conscious
and you're just getting inputs from everywhere and you have no muscles and
you're like jelly and you like can't move and you try to like communicate, but
you can't communicate and like you're just like in this like hell state. I think
it's good we can't remember that. Like my little baby is just exiting that, like
she's starting to like get muscles and have more like autonomy, but like
watching her go through the opening phase, I was like, this does not seem good.
Oh, you think it's kind of like. Like I think it sucks. I think it might be
really violent. Like violent, mentally violent, psychologically violent.
Consciousness emerging, I think is a very violent thing. I think it's possible
that we all carry quite a bit of trauma from it that we don't. I think that
would be a good thing to study because I think addressing that trauma, like I
think that might be. Oh, you mean like echoes of it are still there in the
shadow somewhere. I think it's gotta be, I feel this helplessness, that the like
existential and that like fear of being in like an unknown place, bombarded with
inputs and being completely helpless, like that's gotta be somewhere deep in
your brain and that can't be good for you. What do you think consciousness is?
This whole conversation has impossibly difficult questions. What do you think it
is? This is like so hard. Yeah, we talked about music for like two minutes. All
right. No, I'm just over music. I'm over music. Yeah. I still like it. It has
its purpose. No, I love music. I mean, music's the greatest thing ever. It's my
favorite thing. But I just like, every interview is like, what is your process?
Like, I don't know. I'm just done. I can't do any more. I do wanna ask about
Ableton Live. I'll tell you about Ableton, because Ableton's sick. But no one
ever asks about Ableton though. Yeah, well, because I just need tech support,
maybe. I can help you with your Ableton tech support. Anyway, from Ableton back
to consciousness, what do you, do you think this is a thing that only humans are
capable of? Can robots be conscious? Can, like when you think about entities,
you think there's aliens out there that are conscious? Like, what is
consciousness? There's this Terrence McKenna quote that I found that I fucking
love. Am I allowed to swear on here? Yes. Nature loves courage. You make the
commitment, and nature will respond to that commitment by removing impossible
obstacles. Dream the impossible dream, and the world will not grind you under.
It will lift you up. This is the trick. This is what all these teachers and
philosophers who really counted, who really touched the alchemical gold, this is
what they understood. This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall. This is how
magic is done, by hurling yourself into the abyss and discovering it's a feather
bed. Yeah. And for this reason, I do think there are no technological limits. I
think like, what is already happening here, this is like impossible. This is
insane. And we've done this in a very limited amount of time. And we're
accelerating the rate at which we're doing this. So I think digital
consciousness, or it's inevitable. And we may not be able to even understand
what that means, but I like hurling yourself into the abyss. So we're surrounded
by all this mystery and we just keep hurling ourselves into it, like fearlessly
and keep discovering cool shit. Yeah. Like, I just think it's like, like who
even knows if the laws of physics, the laws of physics are probably just the
current, like as I was saying, speed of light is the current render rate. It's
like, if we're in a simulation, they'll be able to upgrade that. Like I sort of
suspect when we made the James Webb telescope, like part of the reason we made
that is because we had an upgrade, you know? And so now more of space has been
rendered so we can see more of it now. Yeah, but I think humans are super,
super, super limited cognitively. So I wonder if we'll be allowed to create more
intelligent beings that can see more of the universe as their render rate is
upgraded. Maybe we're cognitively limited. Everyone keeps talking about how
we're cognitively limited and AI is gonna render us obsolete, but it's like, you
know, like this is not the same thing as like an amoeba becoming an alligator.
Like it's like, if we create AI, again, that's intelligent design. That's
literally all religions are based on gods that create consciousness. Like we are
God-making. Like what we are doing is incredibly profound. We can't compute even
if we're so much worse than them, like just like unfathomably worse than like,
you know, an omnipotent kind of AI. It's like we, I do not think that they would
just think that we are stupid. I think that they would recognize the profundity
of what we have accomplished. Are we the gods or are they the gods in our- I
mean, we're kind of the gods. It's complicated. It's complicated. Like we're-
But they would acknowledge the value. Well, I hope they acknowledge the value of
paying respect to the creative ancestors. I think they would think it's cool. I
think if curiosity is a trait that we can quantify and put into AI, then I think
if AI are curious, then they will be curious about us and they will not be
hateful or dismissive of us. They might, you know, see us as, I don't know. It's
like, I'm not like, oh, fuck these dogs. Let's just kill all the dogs. Like I
love dogs. Dogs have great utility. Dogs like provide a lot of- We make friends
with them. Yeah. We have a deep connection with them. We anthropomorphize them.
Like we have a real love for dogs, for cats and so on for some reason, even
though they're intellectually much less than us. And I think there is something
sacred about us because it's like, if you look at the universe, like the whole
universe is like cold and dead and sort of robotic. And it's like, you know, AI
intelligence, you know, it's kind of more like the universe. It's like cold and,
you know, logical and, you know, abiding by the laws of physics and whatever.
But like, we're this like loosey-goosey weird art thing that happened. And I
think it's beautiful. And like, I think even if we, I think one of the values,
if consciousness is the thing that is most worth preserving, which I think is
the case, I think consciousness, I think if there's any kind of like religious
or spiritual thing, it should be that consciousness is sacred. Like then, you
know, I still think even if AI render us obsolete and we, climate change, it's
too bad and we get hit by a comet and we don't become a multi-planetary species
fast enough, but like AI is able to populate the universe. Like I imagine, like
if I was an AI, I would find more planets that are capable of hosting biological
life forms and like recreate them. Because we're fun to watch. Yeah, we're fun
to watch. Yeah, but I do believe that AI can have some of the same magic of
consciousness within it. Because consciousness, we don't know what it is. So,
you know, there's some kind of- Or it might be a different magic. It might be
like a strange, a strange, a strange different. Right. Because they're not going
to have hormones. Like I feel like a lot of our magic is hormonal kind of. I
don't know. I think some of our magic is the limitations, the constraints. And
within that, the hormones and all that kind of stuff, the finiteness of life.
And then we get, given our limitations, we come up with creative solutions of
how to dance around those limitations. We partner up like penguins against the
cold. We fall in love. And then love is ultimately some kind of, allows us to
delude ourselves that we're not mortal and finite. And that life is not
ultimately, you live alone. You're born alone, you die alone. And then love is
like for a moment or for a long time, forgetting that. And so we come up with
all these creative hacks that make life like fascinatingly fun. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, fun, yeah. And then AI might have different kinds of fun. Yes. And
hopefully our funds intersect once in a while. I think there would be a little
intersection, there'd be a little intersection of the fun. Yeah. What do you
think is the role of love in the human condition? I think. Why, is it useful? Is
it useful like a hack? Or is this like fundamental to what it means to be human?
The capacity to love. I mean, I think love is the evolutionary mechanism that is
like beginning the intelligent design. Like I was just reading about, do you
know about Kropotkin? He's like an anarchist, like old Russian anarchist. I live
next door to Michael Malice. I don't know if you know who that is. He's an
anarchist. He's a modern day anarchist. Okay. Anarchists are fun. I'm kind of
getting into anarchism a little bit. This is probably, yeah, not a good route to
be taking. Oh no, I think if you're, listen, you should expose yourself to
ideas. There's no harm to thinking about ideas. I think anarchists challenge
systems in interesting ways. And they think in interesting ways. It's just, it's
good for the soul. It's like refreshes your mental palate. I don't think we
should actually, I wouldn't actually ascribe to it, but I've never actually gone
deep on anarchy as a philosophy, so I'm doing. You should still think about it
though. When you read, when you listen, because I'm reading about the Russian
Revolution a lot and it's like, there was the Soviets and Lenin and all that,
but then there was Kropotkin and his anarchist sect. And they were sort of
interesting because he was kind of a technocrat actually. He was like, women can
be more equal if we have appliances. He was really into using technology to
reduce the amount of work people had to do. But so Kropotkin was a biologist or
something. He studied animals. And he was really at the time, I think it's
Nature magazine. I think it might've even started as a Russian magazine, but he
was publishing studies. Everyone was really into Darwinism at the time and
Survival of the Fittest and war is the mechanism by which we become better. And
it was this real kind of cementing this idea in society that violence kill the
weak and that's how we become better. And then Kropotkin was kind of interesting
because he was looking at instances. He was finding all these instances in
Nature where animals were helping each other and stuff. And he was like,
actually love is a survival mechanism. There's so many instances in the animal
kingdom where cooperation and helping weaker creatures and all this stuff is
actually an evolutionary mechanism. I mean, you even look at child rearing.
Child rearing is like immense amounts of just love and goodwill. And just like,
there's no immediate, you're not getting any immediate feedback of like winning.
It's not competitive. It's literally, it's like we actually use love as an
evolutionary mechanism just as much as we use war. And I think we've like
missing the other part and we've reoriented, we've culturally reoriented like
science and philosophy has oriented itself around Darwinism a little bit too
much. And the Kropotkin model I think is equally valid. Like it's like
cooperation and love and stuff is just as essential for species survival and
evolution. It should be a more powerful survival mechanism in the context of
evolution. And it comes back to like, we think engineering is so much more
important than motherhood, but it's like, if you lose the motherhood, the
engineering means nothing. We have no more humans. I think our society should,
the survival of the, the way we conceptualize evolution should really change to
also include this idea, I guess. Yeah, there is some weird thing that seems
irrational that is also core to what it means to be human. So love is one such
thing. It could make you do a lot of irrational things, but that depth of
connection and that loyalty is a powerful thing. Are they irrational or are they
rational? Like it's like, is, you know, maybe losing out on some things in order
to like keep your family together or in order, like it's like, what are our
actual values? Well, right, I mean, the rational thing is if you have a cold
economist perspective, you know, motherhood or sacrificing your career for love,
you know, if you turn in terms of salary, in terms of economic wellbeing, in
terms of flourishing of you as a human being, that could be seen on some kind of
metrics as a irrational decision, a suboptimal decision. But there's the
manifestation of love could be the optimal thing to do. There's a kind of
saying, save one life, save the world. This is the thing that doctors often
face, which is like- Well, it's considered irrational because the profit model
doesn't include social good. Yes, yeah. So if the profit model doesn't include a
social good, then suddenly these would be rational decisions. And this might be
difficult to, you know, it requires a shift in our thinking about profit and
might be difficult to measure social good. Yes, but we're learning to measure a
lot of things. Yeah, digitizing a lot of things. Where we're actually, you know,
quantifying vision and stuff. Like we're like, you know, like you go on Facebook
and they can, like Facebook can pretty much predict our behaviors. Like we're, a
surprising amount of things that seem like mysterious consciousness soul things
have been quantified at this point. So surely we can quantify these other
things. Yeah, but as more and more of us are moving the digital space, I wanted
to ask you about something from a fan perspective. I kind of, you know, you as a
musician, you as an online personality, it seems like you have all these
identities and you play with them. One of the cool things about the internet, it
seems like you can play with identities. So as we move into the digital world
more and more, maybe even in the so-called metaverse. I mean, I love the
metaverse and I love the idea, but like the way this has all played out didn't
go well and people are mad about it. And I think we need to like- I think that's
temporary. I think it's temporary. Just like, you know how all the celebrities
got together and sang the song Imagine by Jett Lennon and everyone started
hating the song Imagine. I'm hoping that's temporary because it's a damn good
song. So I think it's just temporary. Once you actually have virtual worlds,
whatever they're called, metaverse or otherwise, it becomes, I don't know. Well,
we do have virtual worlds, like video games. Elden Ring, have you played Elden
Ring? You have played Elden Ring? I'm really afraid of playing that game.
Literally, I'm azed. It looks way too fun. It looks I would want to go there and
stay there forever. It's, yeah, so fun. It's so nice. Oh man, yeah. So that's
the metaverse. But you're not really, how immersive is it? In the sense that,
this is a three dimension, like virtual reality integration necessary. Can we
really just close our eyes and kind of plug in in the 2D screen and become that
other being for time and really enjoy that journey that we take? And we almost
become that. You're no longer, see, I'm no longer Lex. You're that creature,
whatever the hell it is in that game. Yeah, that is that. I mean, that's why I
love those video games. I really do become those people for a time. But it seems
like, well, the idea of the metaverse, the idea of the digital space, well, even
on Twitter, you get a chance to be somebody for prolonged periods of time, like
across a lifespan. You have a Twitter account for years, for decades, and you're
that person. I don't know if that's a good thing. I feel very tormented by it.
By Twitter specifically, by social media representation of you. I feel like the
public perception of me has gotten so distorted that I find it kind of
disturbing. It's one of the things that's disincentivizing me from wanting to
keep making art, because I'm just like, I've completely lost control of the
narrative. And the narrative is, some of it is my own stupidity, but some of it
has just been hijacked by forces far beyond my control. I kind of got in over my
head in things. I'm just a random Indian musician, but I just got dragged into
geopolitical matters and financial, the stock market and shit. And so it's just
like, there are very powerful people who have at various points in time had very
vested interest in making me seem insane, and I can't fucking fight that. And I
just like, you know, people really want their celebrity figures to be consistent
and stay the same. And people have a lot of emotional investment in certain
things. First of all, I'm artificially more famous than I should be. Isn't
everybody who's famous artificially famous? No, but I should be a weird niche
indie thing. And I make pretty challenging, I do challenging weird fucking shit
a lot. And I accidentally by proxy got, foisted into sort of weird celebrity
culture, but I cannot be media trained. They have put me through so many hours
of media training. I would love to see BF fly in that wall. I can't do, like
when I do, I try so hard and I learn this thing, and I got it, and I'm like, I
got it, I got it, I got it. But I just can't stop saying, my mouth just says
things. And it's just like, I just do things. I just do crazy things. Like I
just, I need to do crazy things. And it's just, I should not be, it's too
jarring for people and the contradictory stuff. And then all the, by
association, it's like, I'm in a very weird position and my public image, the
avatar of me is now this totally crazy thing that is so lost from my control. So
you feel the burden of the avatar having to be static. So the avatar on Twitter,
the avatar on Instagram, on these social platforms, is as a burden, it becomes
like, because like people don't want to accept a changing avatar, a chaotic
avatar. Avatar is a stupid shit sometimes. They think the avatar is morally
wrong or they think the avatar, and maybe it has been. And like, I question it
all the time. Like I'm like, like I don't know if everyone's right and I'm
wrong. I don't know. But a lot of times people ascribe intentions to things, the
worst possible intentions. At this point, people think I'm, but we're just fine.
All kinds of words, yes. Yes, and it's fine. I'm not complaining about it, but
I'm just, it's a curiosity to me that we live these double, triple, quadruple
lives. And I have this other life that is like, more people know my other life
than my real life, which is interesting. Probably, I mean, you too, I guess.
Yeah, but I have the luxury. So we have all different, like, I don't know what
I'm doing. There is an avatar and you're mediating who you are through that
avatar. I have the nice luxury, not the luxury, maybe by intention of not trying
really hard to make sure that there's no difference between the avatar and the
private person. Do you wear a suit all the time? Yeah. You do wear a suit? Not
all the time. Recently, because I get recognized a lot, I have to not wear the
suit to hide. I'm such an introvert. I'm such a social anxiety and all that kind
of stuff, so I have to hide away. I love wearing a suit because it makes me feel
like I'm taking the moment seriously. Like I'm, I don't know. It makes me feel
like a weirdo in the best possible way. Suits feel great. Every time I wear a
suit, I'm like, I don't know why I'm not doing this more. In fashion in general,
if you're doing it for yourself, I don't know, it's a really awesome thing. But
yeah, I think there is definitely a painful way to use social media and an
empowering way. And I don't know if any of us know which is which. So we're
trying to figure that out. Some people, I think Doja Cat is incredible at it.
Just masterful. I don't know if you follow that. So the, okay, so not taking
anything seriously, joking, absurd, humor, that kind of thing. I think Doja Cat
might be the greatest living comedian right now. I'm more entertained by Doja
Cat than actual comedians. She's really fucking funny on the internet. She's
just great at social media. It's just her media. Yeah, the nature of humor.
Humor on social media is also a beautiful thing. The absurdity. The absurdity.
And memes, I just wanna take a moment. I love, when we're talking about art and
credit and authenticity, I love that there's this, I mean, now memes are like,
they're no longer, memes aren't new, but it's still this emergent art form that
is completely egoless and anonymous and we just don't know who made any of it.
And it's like the forefront of comedy. And it's just totally anonymous. And it
just feels really beautiful. It just feels like this beautiful, collective human
art project that's like this decentralized comedy thing that just makes it,
memes add so much to my day and many people's days. And it's just like, I don't
know. I don't think people ever, I don't think we stop enough and just
appreciate how sick it is that memes exist. Because also making a whole brand
new art form in the modern era that's like, didn't exist before. I mean, they
sort of existed, but the way that they exist now as this, like me and my
friends, we joke that we go mining for memes or farming for memes, like a video
game and meme dealers and whatever. Memes are this whole new comedic language.
What's this art form? The interesting thing about it is that lame people seem to
not be good at memes. Like corporate can't infiltrate memes. Yeah, they really
can't. They can try, but it's weird. Cause like- They try so hard. And every
once in a while, I'm like, fine. Like you got a good one. I think I've seen like
one or two good ones, but like, yeah, they really can't. Cause they're even
corporate is infiltrating web three. It's making me really sad, but they can't
infiltrate the memes. And I think there's something really beautiful about that.
That gives power. That's why Dogecoin is powerful. It's like, all right, F you
to sort of anybody who's trying to centralize, who's trying to control the rich
people that are trying to roll in and control this, control the narrative. Wow.
I hadn't thought about that, but. How would you fix Twitter? How would you fix
social media for your own, like you're an optimist, you're a positive person.
There's a bit of a cynicism that you have currently about this particular little
slice of humanity. I tend to think Twitter could be beautiful. I'm not that
cynical about it. I'm not that cynical about it. I actually refuse to be a cynic
on principle. Yes. I was just briefly expressing some personal pathos. Personal
stuff. It was just some personal pathos, but like. Just to vent a little bit,
just to speak. I don't have cancer. I love my family. I have a good life. If
that is my biggest, one of my biggest problems. Then it's a good life. Yeah.
That was a brief, although I do think there are a lot of issues with Twitter,
just in terms of like the public mental health. But due to my proximity to the
current dramas, I honestly feel that I should not have opinions about this
because I think if I'm not a good person, if Elon ends up getting Twitter, that
is a, being the arbiter of truth or public discussion, that is a responsibility.
I do not, I am not qualified to be responsible for that. And I do not want to
say something that might like dismantle democracy. And so I just like, actually,
I actually think I should not have opinions about this because I truly am not, I
don't want to have the wrong opinion about this. And I think I'm too close to
the actual situation. Yeah. Wherein I should not have, I have thoughts in my
brain, but I think I am scared by my proximity to this situation. Isn't that
crazy that a few words that you could say could change world affairs and hurt
people? I mean, that's the nature of celebrity at a certain point, that you have
to be, you have to a little bit, a little bit, not so much that it destroys you,
puts too much constraints, but you have to a little bit think about the impact
of your words. I mean, we as humans, you talk to somebody at a bar, you have to
think about the impact of your words. Like you can say positive things, you can
say negative things, you can affect the direction of one life. But on social
media, your words can affect the direction of many lives. It's crazy. It's a
crazy world to live in. It's worthwhile to consider that responsibility, take it
seriously. Sometimes just like you did, choose kind of silence, choose sort of
respectful. Like I do have a lot of thoughts on the matter. I'm just, if my
thoughts are wrong, this is one situation where the stakes are high. You
mentioned a while back that you were in a cult that centered around bureaucracy,
so you can't really do anything because it involves a lot of paperwork. And I
really love a cult that's just like Kafka-esque. Yes. Just like- I mean, it was
like a joke, but- I know, but I love this idea. The Holy Reign Empire. Yeah, it
was just like a Kafka-esque pro-bureaucracy cult. But I feel like that's what
human civilization is. Is that, because when you said that, I was like, oh, that
is kind of what humanity is, is this bureaucracy cult. I do, yeah, I have this
theory. I really think that we really, bureaucracy is starting to kill us. And I
think we need to reorient laws and stuff. Like, I think we just need sunset
clauses on everything. Like, I think the rate of change in culture is happening
so fast, and the rate of change in technology and everything is happening so
fast. It's like, when you see these hearings about social media and Cambridge
Analytica and everyone talking, it's like, even from that point, so much
technological change has happened from those hearings. And it's just like, we're
trying to make all these laws now about AI and stuff. I feel like we should be
updating things every five years. And one of the big issues in our society right
now is we're just getting bogged down by laws, and it's making it very hard to
change things and develop things. Like, in Austin, I don't want to speak on this
too much, but one of my friends is working on a housing bill in Austin to try to
prevent a San Francisco situation from happening here, because obviously we're
getting a little mini San Francisco here. Like, housing prices are skyrocketing.
It's causing massive gentrification. This is really bad for anyone who's not
super rich. Like, there's so much bureaucracy. Part of the reason this is
happening is because you need all these permits to build. It takes years to get
permits to build anything. It's so hard to build. And so there's very limited
housing, and there's a massive influx of people. And it's just like, this is a
microcosm of problems that are happening all over the world, where it's just
like we're dealing with laws that are like 10, 20, 30, 40, 100, 200 years old,
and they are no longer relevant, and it's just slowing everything down and
causing massive social pain. Yeah, but it's also makes me sad when I see
politicians talk about technology and when they don't really get it. But most
importantly, they lack curiosity and that inspired excitement about how stuff
works and all that stuff. They see, they have a very cynical view of technology.
It's like tech companies are just trying to do evil on the world from their
perspective, and they have no curiosity about how recommender systems work or
how AI systems work, natural language processing, how robotics works, how
computer vision works. They always take the most cynical possible interpretation
of what technology will be used. And we should definitely be concerned about
that, but if you're constantly worried about that and you're regulating based on
that, you're just going to slow down all the innovation. I do think a huge
priority right now is undoing the bad energy surrounding the emergence of
Silicon Valley. I think that a lot of things were very irresponsible during that
time. Even just this current whole thing with Twitter and everything, it's like
there has been a lot of negative outcomes from the sort of technocracy boom. But
one of the things that's happening is that it's alienating people from wanting
to care about technology. And I actually think technology is probably some of
the better, probably the best. I think we can fix a lot of our problems more
easily with technology than with fighting the powers that be, as not to go back
to the Star Wars quote or the Buckminster Fuller quote. Let's go to some dark
questions. If we may, for a time, what is the darkest place you've ever gone in
your mind? Is there a time, a period of time, a moment that you remember that
was difficult for you? I mean, when I was 18, my best friend died of a heroin
overdose. And it was like my, and then shortly after that, one of my other best
friends committed suicide. And that sort of like coming into adulthood, dealing
with two of the most important people in my life dying in extremely disturbing,
violent ways was a lot. That was a lot. Do you miss them? Yeah, definitely miss
them. Did that make you think about your own life, about the finiteness of your
own life, the places your mind can go? Did you ever, in the distance, far away,
contemplate just your own death or maybe even taking your own life? Oh, never.
Oh no. I'm so, I love my life. I cannot fathom suicide. I'm so scared of death.
I haven't, I'm too scared of death. My manager, my manager's like the most Zen
guy. My manager's always like, you need to accept death. You need to accept
death. And I'm like, look, I can do your meditation. I can do the meditation,
but I cannot accept death. I like, I will fight. So you're terrified of death.
I'm terrified of death. I will like fight. Although I actually think death is
important. I recently went to this meeting about immortality and in the process
of- That's the actual topic of the meeting. All right, I'm sorry. No, no, it was
this girl. It was a bunch of people working on like anti-aging, like stuff. It
was like some like seminary thing about it. And I went in really excited. I was
like, yeah, like, okay, like, what do you got? Like, how can I live for 500
years or a thousand years? And then like over the course of the meeting, like it
was sort of like right. It was like two or three days after the Russian invasion
started. And I was like, man, like what if Putin was immortal? Like, what if I'm
like, man, maybe immortality is not good. I mean, like if you get into the later
Dune stuff, the immortals cause a lot of problem. Because as we were talking
about earlier with the music and like brains calcify, like good people could
become immortal, but bad people could become immortal. But I also think even the
best people power corrupts and power alienates you from like the common human
experience and- Right, so the people that get more and more powerful. Even the
best people who like, whose brains are amazing. Like, I think death might be
important. I think death is part of, you know, like I think with AI, one thing
we might want to consider, I don't know, I want to talk about AI. I'm such not
an expert and probably everyone has all these ideas and they're already figured
out. But when I talk- Nobody is an expert in anything, see. Okay, go ahead. But
when I- You know what we're talking about? Yeah, but like, it's just like, I
think some kind of pruning, but it's a tricky thing because if there's too much
of a focus on youth culture, then you don't have the wisdom. So I feel like
we're in a tricky, we're in a tricky moment right now in society where it's
like, we've really perfected living for a long time. So there's all these really
like old people who are like really voting against the wellbeing of the young
people, you know? And like, it's like, there shouldn't be all this student debt
and we need like healthcare, like universal healthcare and like just voting
against like best interests. But then you have all these young people that don't
have the wisdom that are like, like, yeah, we need communism and stuff. And it's
just like, like literally I got canceled at one point for, I ironically used a
Stalin quote in my high school yearbook, but it was actually like a diss against
my high school. I saw that. Yeah, and people were like, you used to be a
Stalinist and now you're a class traitor. And it's like, it's like, oh man, just
like, please Google Stalin. Yeah. Please Google Stalin. Like, you know- Ignoring
the lessons of history, yes. And it's like, we're in this really weird middle
ground where it's like, we are not finding the happy medium between wisdom and
fresh ideas and they're fighting each other. And it's like, like really, like
what we need is like, like the fresh ideas and the wisdom to be like
collaborating. And it's like- Well, the fighting in a way is the searching for
the happy medium. And in a way, maybe we are finding the happy medium. Maybe
that's what the happy medium looks like. And for AI systems, there has to be,
you have reinforcement learning, you have the dance between exploration and
exploitation, sort of doing crazy stuff to see if there's something better than
what you think is the optimal and then doing the optimal thing and dancing back
and forth from that. You would, Stuart Russell, I don't know if you know that,
is an AI guy with, thinks about sort of how to control super intelligent AI
systems. And his idea is that we should inject uncertainty and sort of humility
into AI systems that they never, as they get wiser and wiser and wiser and more
intelligent, they're never really sure. They always doubt themselves. And in
some sense, when you think of young people, that's a mechanism for doubt. It's
like, it's how society doubts whether the thing it has converged towards is the
right answer. So the voices of the young people is a society asking itself a
question. The way I've been doing stuff for the past 50 years, maybe it's the
wrong way. And so you can have all of that within one AI system. I also think
though that we need to, I mean, actually that's actually really interesting and
really cool. But I also think there's a fine balance of, I think we maybe also
overvalue the idea that the old systems are always bad. And I think there are
things that we are perfecting and we might be accidentally overthrowing things
that we actually have gotten to a good point. Just because we value disruption
so much and we value fighting against the generations before us so much, that
there's also an aspect of sometimes we're taking two steps forward, one step
back because, okay, maybe we kind of did solve this thing and now we're fucking
it up. And so I think there's a middle ground there too. We're in search of that
happy medium. Let me ask you a bunch of crazy questions, okay? You can answer in
a short way or in a long way. What's the scariest thing you've ever done? These
questions are gonna be ridiculous. Something tiny or something big. Skydiving or
touring your first record, going on this podcast. I've had two crazy brushes,
like really scary brushes with death where I randomly got away unscathed. I
don't know if I should talk about those on here. Well, I don't know. I think I
might be the luckiest person alive though. This might be too dark for a podcast
though. I feel like I don't know if this is good content for a podcast. I don't
know what is good content. It might hijack. Here's a safer one. I mean, having a
baby really scared me. Before, during, after. Just the birth process, surgery.
Just having a baby is really scary. Just like the medical aspect of it, not the
responsibility. Were you ready for the responsibility? Were you ready to be a
mother? All the beautiful things that comes with motherhood that you were
talking about, all the changes and all that, were you ready for that? Did you
feel ready for that? No. I think it took about nine months to start getting
ready for it. And I'm still getting more ready for it because now you keep
realizing more things as they start getting- As the consciousness grows. And
stuff you didn't notice with the first one, now that you've seen the first one
older, you're noticing it more. Like the sort of like existential horror of
coming into consciousness with baby Y or baby Sailor Mars or whatever. She has
like so many names at this point that we really need to probably settle on one.
If you could be someone else for a day, someone alive today, but somebody you
haven't met yet, who would you be? Would I be modeling their brain state or
would I just be in their body? You can choose the degree to which you're
modeling their brain state. Because you can still take a third person
perspective and realize, you have to realize that you're- Can they be alive or
can it be dead? No. Oh. Can it be anyone- They would be brought back to life,
right? If they're dead. Yeah, you can bring people back. Definitely Hitler or
Stalin. Huh. I wanna understand evil. You would need to, oh, to experience what
it feels like. I wanna be in their brain feeling what they feel. That might
change you forever, returning from that. Yes, but I think it would also help me
understand how to prevent it and fix it. That might be one of those things, once
you experience it, it'll be a burden to know it. Because you won't be able to
trust it. Yeah, but a lot of things are burdens. But it's a useful burden. But
it's a useful burden. Yeah. That for sure, I wanna understand evil and
psychopathy and that. I have all these fake Twitter accounts where I go into
different algorithmic bubbles to try to understand. I'll keep getting in fights
with people and realize we're not actually fighting. I think we used to exist in
a monoculture before social media and stuff. We kinda all got fed the same
thing. So we were all speaking the same cultural language. But I think recently,
one of the things that we aren't diagnosing properly enough with social media is
that there's different dialects. There's so many different dialects of Chinese.
There are now becoming different dialects of English. I am realizing there are
people who are saying the exact same things, but they're using completely
different verbiage. And we're punishing each other for not using the correct
verbiage. And we're completely misunderstanding. People are just
misunderstanding what the other people are saying. And I just got in a fight
with a friend about anarchism and communism and shit for two hours. And then by
the end of the conversation, and then she'd say something, and I'm like, but
that's literally what I'm saying. And she was like, what? And then I was like,
fuck, we've different, I'm like, we're, our English, the way we are
understanding terminology is drastically, our algorithm bubbles are creating
many dialects. And- Of how language is interpreted, how language is used, that's
so fascinating. And so we're having these arguments that we do not need to be
having. And there's polarization that's happening that doesn't need to be
happening because we've got these algorithmically created dialects occurring.
Plus on top of that, there's also different parts of the world that speak
different languages. So there's literally lost in translation kind of
communication. I happen to know the Russian language and just know how different
it is. Yeah. Then the English language, and I just wonder how much is lost in a
little bit of- Man, I actually, cause I have a question for you. I have a song
coming out tomorrow with Ice Peak, who are a Russian band. And I speak a little
bit of Russian and I was looking at the title and the title in English doesn't
match the title in Russian. I'm curious about this. Cause look, it says- What's
the English title? The title in English is Last Day. And then the title in
Russian is New Day, my pronunciation sucks, Новый день. Like what? Yeah, New
Day. The New Day. Yeah, New Day, New Day. Like it's two different meanings.
Yeah, New Day, yeah. Like am I- Yeah, yeah, New Day. Yeah. New Day, but Last
Day. Новый день, so Last Day would be Последний день. Yeah. Maybe they- Or maybe
the title includes both the Russian and it's for- Maybe. Maybe it's for
bilingual. To be honest, Новый день sounds better than just musically. Like
Новый день is New Day. That's the current one. And Последний день is the last
day. I think Новый день- I don't like Новый день. But the meaning is so
different. Yeah, yeah, no, I- That's kind of awesome actually though. There's an
explicit sort of contrast like that. If everyone on earth disappeared and it was
just you left, what would your day look like? Like what would you do?
Everybody's dead as far as you- Are there corpses there? Well, seriously, it's a
big- Let me think through this. It's a big difference if there's just like birds
singing versus if there's like corpses littering the street. Yeah, there's
corpses everywhere. I'm sorry. And you don't actually know what happened and you
don't know why you survived. And you don't even know if there's others out
there, but it seems clear that it's all gone. What would you do? What would I
do? Listen, I'm somebody who really enjoys the moment, enjoys life. I would just
go on like enjoying the inanimate objects. I would just look for food, basic
survival. But most of it is just, listen, when I just, I take walks and I look
outside and I'm just happy that we get to exist on this planet to be able to
breathe air. It's just all beautiful. It's full of colors, all of this kind of
stuff. Just, there's so many things about life, your own life, conscious life
that's fucking awesome. So I would just enjoy that. But also maybe after a few
weeks, the engineer would start coming out, like wanna build some things. Maybe
there's always hope searching for another human. Maybe. Probably searching for
another human. Probably trying to get to a TV or radio station and broadcast
something. I- That's interesting, I didn't think about that. So like really-
Yeah. Maximize your ability to connect with others. Yeah. Like probably try to
find another person. Would you be excited to meet another person or terrified?
Because, you know- I'd be excited, even if they- No matter what. Yeah, yeah,
yeah. Being alone for the last however long of my life would be really bad.
That's the one instance I might, I don't think I'd kill myself, but I might kill
myself if I had to undergo that. Do you love people? Do you love connection to
other humans? I kind of hate people too, but yeah. It's a love-hate
relationship. Yeah. I feel like we have a bunch of weird Nietzsche questions and
stuff though. Oh yeah. Like I wonder, because I'm like, when podcast, I'm like,
is this interesting for people to just have like, or I don't know, maybe people
do like this. When I listen to podcasts, I'm into like the lore, like the hard
lore. Like I just love like Dan Carlin. I'm like, give me the facts, just like
get, just like the facts into my bloodstream. But you also don't know, like
you're a fascinating mind to explore. So you don't realize as you're talking
about stuff, the stuff you've taken for granted is actually unique and
fascinating. The way you think, not always what, like the way you reason through
things is the fascinating thing to listen to, because people kind of see, oh,
there's other humans that think differently, that explore thoughts differently.
That's the cool, that's also cool. So yeah, Dan Carlin retelling of history, by
the way, his retelling of history is very, I think what's exciting is not the
history, is his way of thinking about history. No, I think Dan Carlin is one of
the people, like when Dan Carlin was one of the people that really started
getting me excited about like revolutionizing education, because like Dan Carlin
instilled, I already like really liked history, but he instilled like an
obsessive love of history in me to the point where like now I'm fucking reading,
like going to bed, reading like part four of the rise and fall of the third
Reich or whatever. Like I like have like dense ass history, but like he like
opened that door that like made me want to be a scholar of that topic. Like it's
like, I feel like he's such a good teacher. He just like, you know, and it sort
of made me feel like one of the things we could do with education is like find
like the world's great, the teachers that like create passion for the topic,
because autodidacticism, I don't know how to say that properly, but like
self-teaching is like much faster than being lectured to. Like it's much more
efficient to sort of like be able to teach yourself and then ask a teacher
questions when you don't know what's up. But like, you know, that's why it's
like in university and stuff, like you can learn so much more material so much
faster because you're doing a lot of the learning on your own and you're going
to the teachers for when you get stuck. But like these teachers that can inspire
passion for a topic, I think that is one of the most invaluable skills in our
whole species. Like, because if you can do that, then you, it's like AI, like AI
is gonna teach itself so much more efficiently than we can teach it. We just
needed to get it to the point where it can teach itself. And then- It finds the
motivation to do so, right? Yeah. So like you inspire it to do so. Yeah. It
could teach itself. What do you make of the fact, you mentioned Rise and Fall of
the Third Reich. I just- Have you read that? I read it twice. You read it twice?
Yes. Okay, so no one even knows what it is. Yeah. And I'm like, wait, I thought
this was like a super popping book. Super pop. I'm not like that. I'm not that
far in it, but it is, it's so interesting. Yeah. It's written by a person that
was there, which is very important to kind of- You know, you start being like,
how could this possibly happen? And then when you read Rise and Fall of the
Third Reich, people tried really hard for this to not happen. People tried, they
almost reinstated a monarchy at one point to try to stop this from happening.
Like they almost like abandoned democracy to try to get this to not happen. At
least the way it makes me feel is that there's a bunch of small moments on which
history can turn. Yes. It's like small meetings. Yes. Human interactions. And
that's both terrifying and inspiring because it's like, even just attempts at
assassinating Hitler, like time and time again, failed. And they were so close.
Was it like Operation Valkyrie? Such a good... And then there's also the role
of, that's a really heavy burden, which is from a geopolitical perspective, the
role of leaders to see evil before it truly becomes evil, to anticipate it, and
to stand up to evil. Because evil is actually pretty rare in this world at a
scale that Hitler was. We tend to, in the modern discourse, kind of call people
evil too quickly. If you look at ancient history, like there was a ton of
Hitlers. I actually think it's more the norm than, like again, going back to
like my sort of intelligent design theory, I think one of the things we've been
successfully doing in our slow move from survival of the fittest to intelligent
design is we've kind of been eradicating... Like if you look at like ancient
Assyria and stuff, like that shit was like brutal. And just like the heads on
the, like brutal, like Genghis Khan, just like genocide after genocide after
genocide. There's like throwing plague bodies over the walls and decimating
whole cities, or like the Muslim conquests of like Damascus and shit. Just like
people, cities used to get leveled all the fucking time. Okay, get into the
Bronze Age collapse. It's basically, there was like almost like Roman level like
society. Like there was like all over the world, like global trade, like
everything was awesome through a mix of, I think a bit of climate change and
then the development of iron. Cause basically bronze could only come from this,
the way to make bronze, like everything had to be funneled through this one
Iranian mine. And so it's like, there was just this one supply chain. And this
is one of the things that makes me worried about supply chains and why I think
we need to be so thoughtful about, I think our biggest issue with society right
now, like the thing that is most likely to go wrong is probably supply chain
collapse, cause war, climate change, whatever, like anything that causes supply
chain collapse, our population is too big to handle that. And like the thing
that seems to cause dark ages is mass supply chain collapse. But the Bronze Age
collapse happened, it was sort of like this ancient collapse that happened where
literally like ancient Egypt, all these cities, everything just got like
decimated, destroyed, abandoned cities, like hundreds of them. There was like a
flourishing society, like we were almost coming to modernity and everything got
leveled and they had this mini dark ages, but it was just like, there's so
little writing or recording from that time that like, there isn't a lot of
information about the Bronze Age collapse, but it was basically equivalent to
like medieval, the medieval dark ages, but it just happened, I don't know the
years, but like thousands of years earlier. And then we sort of like recover
from the Bronze Age collapse, empire reemerged, writing and trade and everything
reemerged, and then we of course had the more contemporary dark ages. And then
over time we've designed mechanism that lessened and lessened the capability for
the destructive power centers to emerge. There's more recording about the more
contemporary dark ages. So I think we have like a better understanding of how to
avoid it, but I still think we're at high risk for it. I think that's one of the
big risks right now. So the natural state of being for humans is for there to be
a lot of Hitlers, which has gotten really good at making it hard for them to
emerge. We've gotten better at collaboration and resisting the power, like
authoritarians to come to power. We're trying to go country by country, like
we're moving past this, we're kind of like slowly incrementally moving towards
not scary old school war stuff. And I think seeing it happen in some of the
countries that at least nominally are supposed to have moved past that, that's
scary because it reminds us that it can happen in the places that have made,
supposedly, hopefully moved past that. And possibly at a civilization level,
like you said, supply chain collapse might make people resource constrained,
might make people desperate, angry, hateful, violent, and drag us right back in.
I mean, supply chain collapse is how, like the ultimate thing that caused the
middle ages was supply chain collapse. It's like people, because people were
reliant on a certain level of technology, like people, like you look at like
Britain, like they had glass, like people had aqueducts, people had like indoor
heating and cooling and like running water and like buy food from all over the
world and trade and markets. Like people didn't know how to hunt and forage and
gather. And so we're in a similar situation, we are not educated enough to
survive without technology. So if we have a supply chain collapse that like
limits our access to technology, there will be like massive starvation and
violence and displacement and war. Like, you know, it's also like, yeah, in my
opinion, it's like the primary marker of dark, like what a dark age is. Well,
technology is kind of enabling us to be more resilient in terms of supply chain,
in terms of to all the different catastrophic events that happened to us.
Although the pandemic has kind of challenged our preparedness for the
catastrophic. What do you think is the coolest invention humans come up with?
The wheel, fire, cooking meat. Computers. Computers. Freaking computers.
Internet or computers, which one? What do you think the- Previous technologies,
I mean, may have even been more profound and moved us to a certain degree, but I
think the computers are what make us homotechno. I think this is what, it's a
brain augmentation. And so it like allows for actual evolution, like the
computers accelerate the degree to which all the other technologies can also be
accelerated. Would you classify yourself as a homo sapien or a homotechno?
Definitely homotechno. So you're one of the earliest of the species. I think
most of us are. Like, as I said, I think if you looked at brain scans of us
versus humans 100 years ago, it would look very different. I think we are
physiologically different. Just even the interaction with the devices has
changed our brains. Well, and if you look at, a lot of studies are coming out to
show there's a degree of inherited memory. So some of these physiological
changes in theory should be, we should be passing them on. So that's not like an
instance of physiological change that's gonna fizzle out. In theory, that should
progress to our offspring. Speaking of offspring, what advice would you give to
a young person, like in high school? Whether there be an artist, a creative, an
engineer, any kind of career path, or maybe just life in general, how they can
live a life they can be proud of? I think one of my big thoughts, and like,
especially now having kids, is that I don't think we spend enough time teaching
creativity. And I think creativity is a muscle like other things. And there's a
lot of emphasis on, learn how to play the piano and then you can write a song.
Or learn the technical stuff and then you can do a thing. But I think it's, I
have a friend who's world's greatest guitar player, amazing producer, works with
other people, but he's really sort of like, he engineers and records things and
does solos, but he doesn't really make his own music. And I was talking to him
and I was like, dude, you're so talented at music, why don't you make music or
whatever? And he was like, cause I got, I'm too old, I never learned the
creative muscle. And it's like, it's embarrassing. It's like learning the
creative muscle takes a lot of failure. And it also sort of, if when you're
being creative, you're throwing paint at a wall and a lot of stuff will fail. So
like part of it is like a tolerance for failure and humiliation. And that's
somehow that's easier to develop when you're young. Yeah. Or be persist through
it when you're young. Everything is easier to develop when you're young. Yes.
And the younger the better. It could destroy you. I mean, that's the shitty
thing about creativity. Failure could destroy you if you're not careful, but
that's the risk worth taking. But also, at a young age, developing a tolerance
to failure is good. I fail all the time. Like I do stupid shit all the time.
Like in public, I get canceled for, I make all kinds of mistakes, but I just
like am very resilient about making mistakes. And so then like I do a lot of
things that like other people wouldn't do. And like, I think my greatest asset
is my creativity. And I like, I think paint, like tolerance to failure is just a
super essential thing that should be taught before other things. Brilliant
advice. Yeah, yeah. I wish everybody encouraged sort of failure more as opposed
to kind of- Because we like punish failure. We're like, no, we're not, like when
we were teaching kids, we're like, no, that's wrong. Like that's, you know, like
X keeps like, will be like wrong. Like he'll say like crazy things. Like X keeps
being like bubble car, bubble car. And I'm like, and you know, I'm like, what's
a bubble car? Like, but like, it doesn't, like, but I don't want to be like, no,
you're wrong. I'm like, you're thinking of weird, crazy shit. Like, I don't know
what a bubble car is, but like- He's creating worlds and they might be
internally consistent. And through that, he might discover something fundamental
about this world. Yeah, or he'll like rewrite songs, like with words that he
prefers. So like, instead of baby shark, he says baby car. It's like- Maybe he's
onto something. Let me ask the big ridiculous question. We were kind of dancing
around it, but what do you think is the meaning of this whole thing we have
here? Of human civilization, of life on earth, but in general, just life. What's
the meaning of life? C. Have you, did you read Novosin yet? By James Lovelock?
You're doing a lot of really good book recommendations here. I haven't even
finished this, so I'm a huge fraud yet again. But like really early in the book,
he says this amazing thing. Like, I feel like everyone's so sad and cynical.
Like everyone's like the Fermi paradox and everyone, I just keep hearing people
being like, fuck, what if we're alone? Like, oh no, ah, like, ah, ah. And I'm
like, okay, but like, wait, what if this is the beginning? Like in Novosin, he
says, this is not gonna be a correct, I can't like memorize quotes, but he says
something like, what if our consciousness, like right now, like this is the
universe waking up. Like what if instead of discovering the universe, this is
the universe, like this is the evolution of the literal universe herself. Like
we are not separate from the universe. Like this is the universe waking up. This
is the universe seeing herself for the first time. Like this is- The universe
becoming conscious, the first time we were part of that. Yeah, because it's
like, we aren't separate from the universe. Like this could be like an
incredibly sacred moment and maybe like social media and all these things, the
stuff where we're all getting connected together, like maybe these are the
neurons connecting of the like collective super intelligence that is, you know-
Waking up. Yeah, like, you know, it's like, maybe instead of something cynical,
or maybe if there's something to discover, like maybe this is just, you know,
we're a blastocyst of like some incredible kind of consciousness or being. And
just like in the first three years of life for human children, we'll forget
about all the suffering that we're going through now. I think we'll probably
forget about this. I mean, probably, you know, artificial intelligence will
eventually render us obsolete. I don't think they'll do it in a malicious way,
but I think probably we are very weak. The sun is expanding. Like, I don't know,
like hopefully we can get to Mars, but like we're pretty vulnerable. And I, you
know, like, I think we can coexist for a long time with AI and we can also
probably make ourselves less vulnerable, but, you know, I just think
consciousness, sentience, self-awareness, like I think this might be the single
greatest like moment in evolution ever. And like, maybe this is, you know, the
true beginning of life. And we're just, we're the blue green algae, or we're
like the single celled organisms of something amazing. The universe awakens and
this is it. Yeah. Well, see, you're an incredible person. You're a fascinating
mind. You should definitely do, your friend Liv mentioned that you guys were
thinking of maybe talking. I would love it if you explored your mind in this
kind of medium more and more by doing a podcast with her or just in any kind of
way. So you're an awesome person. It's an honor to know you. It's an honor to
get to sit down with you late at night, which is like surreal. And I really
enjoyed it. Thank you for talking today. Yeah, no, I mean, huge honor. I feel
very underqualified to be here, but I'm a big fan. I've been listening to the
podcast a lot and yeah, me and Liv would appreciate any advice and help. And
we're definitely gonna do that, so. Yeah. Anytime, thank you. Cool, thank you.
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Grimes. To support this podcast,

some words from Oscar Wilde. Yes, I'm a dreamer. For a dreamer is one who can
only find her way by moonlight. And her punishment is that she sees the dawn
before the rest of the world. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next
time. === Transcript generated by Podium.page Help us spread the word by

Hey, yeah, i guess. before we get into it, I just want to say, like this year's
theme is Face the Future and I feel like what a way to round off this year's
conference with someone who's, I think, one of the most fascinating minds and an
inventor, a visionary. Can we make some noise for Grimes everyone? I have to
say, like I was saying to you just before we came on, like I genuinely am such a
big fan of you and it's for me, it's a big moment to be here at an electronic
music conference that I'm the co-host of, talking to one of my favourite
artists. you actually got me into electronic music, like when I was a teenager,
so I want to say thanks for that. 0:00:54 - Grimes: Oh well, thanks for having
me, and it's fun to meet like young women doing it too. I feel like, yeah, when
I was starting out, there was almost nobody and it's cool to just meet people
doing things. 0:01:03 - Speaker 1 It's very cool. It's scary to talk. We're just
going to have a little casual chat, so we're going to be good. So we're here in
Ibiza. You're a fan of Ibiza? 0:01:12 - Grimes: I love it here yeah. 0:01:14 -
Interviewer: Yeah. What do you love about it? 0:01:17 - Grimes: I mean I had
like my first kind of foray into dance music here, because Richie Hotten invited
me out and actually that's when the boiler room thing happened And yeah, i just
spent like a week and a half here, two weeks, just with Richie and seeing him
play all the time and seeing a bunch of dance stuff, and at that point I was
just making indie music and stuff and so that just totally I don't know rewrote
my conception of what kind of music I wanted to make and what I loved. And yeah,
i've been back probably like five or six times ever since. 0:01:52 -
Interviewer: Yes, i feel like there's something like it's a bit cringe to say
this, but there is something really magical about like arriving here. You get
off the plane, the seas, that beautiful like. If you're like a seafood lover,
like I'm obsessed with seafood, so I'm just like straight to the beach, straight
to the restaurant. I kind of hate the sea, you hate the sea. 0:02:09 - Grimes: I
grew up No, i grew up by the ocean. I recently realized that, like that, i sort
of hate nature Because I love cities. But Ibiza has a lot of clubs and like
really good sound systems and stuff. 0:02:26 - Interviewer: So, against all
odds, you do actually like being here Yeah, yeah. And we mentioned the Boiler
Room moment. Like I don't know if anyone here has seen that Boiler Room moment
with Grimes. 0:02:37 - Grimes: Look it's ancient history. Now I wonder It is
People still remember. It's also a relic of a different time, because you would
never get canceled for that now. No, like it's one of the things it actually
does show like a progression in the culture away from sexism. 0:02:54 -
Interviewer: Definitely, but I feel like for me it's one of the best things on
the internet. I think it was like a cultural reset watching you play. Well, I
want for Christmas as you, in summer at a villa party. 0:03:03 - Grimes: Yeah,
we got it taken down because it was so extreme and I was getting so many death
threats at the time, which is now so funny. 0:03:10 - Interviewer: So it's
techno purists right. 0:03:12 - Grimes: Yeah, they really were mad at me. It did
encourage me to learn how to DJ properly. It was a fear-based endeavor, but
still now it's very useful. 0:03:23 - Interviewer: I think we should release the
set one day. You know, we got to find the set. 0:03:26 - Grimes: That's why I'm
like we need to actually find it and release it, because I wasn't playing off an
iPad or an iPhone. What were you doing on a? I mean, it was still like
something. It was like a tractor or something on a lap day. It wasn't like
mind-blowing by any stretch. 0:03:39 - Interviewer: And yeah, You were playing
bangers, though, so You were playing bangers. 0:03:44 - Grimes: Yeah. 0:03:44 -
Interviewer: That's what it's all about, yeah. 0:03:46 - Grimes: All right?
0:03:48 - Interviewer: Well, we've spoken about the past. I guess let's bring it
to now. I think I was thinking about what your fans would want to know about you
and hear from you, and you've done a lot of teasing over the years Book one,
book two, the lesbian space opera, the war. 0:04:06 - Grimes: Book one is the
space opera. Okay. 0:04:10 - Interviewer: Give us a bit of an insight into this
world that you're creating. 0:04:15 - Grimes: I mean basically Well, so book one
I can't say why, but I wasn't allowed to release it for a very long time. So
it's, i got kind of bored of it. I will release it, but I just had to start
making new music, okay. But in December I decided to go to SF because the AI
stuff was taking off And I really just wanted to go into the center of the AI
stuff. And I think there's a really interesting moment in tech And it was
literally just cold calling companies and being like can I come in and see what
you guys are doing? And we found all about brand computer interfaces and just
talked to a lot of people on the forefront of AI And I just did a big research,
deep dive, and so now I'm reorienting what I'm doing musically, i think, to
engage with that. I feel like a lot of the most profound art in the world is
when there's kind of like a dance between the artist and the engineer. I always
say but when you ask a lot of people what inspired you to become an engineer,
like they always say Isaac Asimov or something like that, it's like the way art
and fiction engages with futurism. I think that's something that's really
profound and really important, and I think we are in a weird point in society
where people feel like tech and art are oppositional forces. One of the things I
like about dance music is I feel like dance music is this kind of sacred place
where art and tech really are married to each other. We all use plug-ins, we're
all trying to Musicians dance musicians do actually really care about
technology, and I think that's a really beautiful thing and I think it's
something that has always made dance music extra special to me, and it's one of
the reasons I care about it more, because it's not just about writing a nice
song. It's about truly playing with form and playing with sculpting reality and
creating sounds, creating new sounds and new landscapes and literally new
realities, if you want to call it that. And so, yeah, i am now in the process of
trying to make music based on my spy mission, which was successful. 0:06:37 -
Interviewer: Amazing. I mean I want to dive into all the AI stuff in a moment,
but I want to pull up this thing you said in an interview with Lex Friedman,
which I thought was fascinating. You used the term like that we're no longer
homo sapiens, but we're now homo techno, and I'd love for you to like tell
everyone about this, because I thought what you said about it was so cool.
0:06:59 - Grimes: I mean technically, i guess the better term is techno sapiens,
but it just doesn't roll off the tongue quite as nicely. But yeah, i sort of
believe we're not homo sapiens anymore. I think we are a lot more transhumanist
than we would think like. We are closer to cyborgs than we would think Like just
because we aren't augmenting our body with like surgery to do that. Yet You
know, we live with phones and computers and like even these things you know like
we are fully integrated with technology in a manner that like if, if we lost all
of this tomorrow, there would be like untold chaos. People wouldn't know how to
function, people wouldn't be able to get places, people. You know like even like
the nature of memory has changed. It's like when you keep so much information
outside of your brain, like you process things in a really different way. And
yeah, i think people are adapting to the technology around us. I was even just
saying the other day like um Tick Tock is like creating this sort of like weird
return to oral culture. But that's like this, like weird digital version of oral
culture. Like when people are like stressed about the illiteracy crisis with the
kids. You know, it's like the kids are actually like fusing with the computer to
become like weird Homeric storytellers, and I think, yeah, i would not identify
as a homo sapien. I think I am a tool using technology, using creature that like
my, like my life would be like, that is essential to my existence, and I think
many of the people I know agree. I mean, i'm like unemployable without it.
0:08:40 - Interviewer: So like, yeah, You're in the right industry, then I
think, yeah, um, i want to go into, like your world and we've got it on the
screen, like Elf Tech, which I'd love for you to tell us about it. This feels
like it's this immersive platform where you can engage with your art and your
music, and I know you tweeted as well last week saying that anyone who wants to
like use an AI generated version of your voice, that you'd split 50% of the
royalties, and I thought that was really really interesting. Just kind of give
them like where we're out of technology and like where art's going. And so,
yeah, what do you hope to accomplish by doing that and with using Elf Tech as
well? 0:09:28 - Grimes: Um, i, so I really feel strongly that there's way too
much gate to keeping in music. Um, and you know, i think we're in a. The thing
with music and art is you're also competing with the attention economy, and so I
think the artists have a responsibility, the artists who have like surpassed the
attention economy thing like, and who can sort of get people to regularly pay
attention with to them. Um, here, let me start this better Copyright sucks. Um,
i don't think art belongs to anyone. I think art is a conversation that we have
with, like all the humans that came before us and that we and its messages were
leaving to everyone coming after us. Um, and the idea of art being so
intertwined with the ego is like a very modern concept, like this very like 20th
century concept. You know, like when we look at the pyramids and hieroglyphics
and like all art until kind of like the industrial revolution ish, like you have
some instances of authorship, but like mostly it's anonymous, and even when you
know you're in a room, like you're in a beautiful place, like you're surrounded
by art a lot of the time, and like architecture, and you don't know who made it.
You know, um, and I think music, the music industry has been very defined by
lawyers and I kind of distrust anything that is super defined by lawyers And I
think it puts a real stranglehold on creativity. And I think a lot of the best
moments in art were the moments when there was the least copy right, like like
the early years of rap and sampling and all this stuff. Um, and if you look at,
i also think you look at something like Harry Potter or League of Legends, like
companies that don't penalize people for fan art. Um, like there is just such
brilliant communities and still innovative art made with that IP all the time
that like doesn't even come from the original creators and those communities
just seem like really healthy and it just seems like a really beautiful thing.
And it seems beautiful that you could love something like. You know, like I
bought like a decent amount of League of Legends fan art from artists and it's
like interesting that you could be a fan of something and then you could like
earn from it too. You know, i think it's like a you're like giving something
back to people, um, but you know it's really hard to make it as a musician right
now and I think Just like why shouldn't everyone be able to use your voice or
whatever. It just seems cool and exciting and then, like I don't know like
beautiful things might come from it. You know, when people like a big artist do
these writing camps, they like search the world for the best people to come in
and write and they spend all this money doing it. And it's like you could just
not spend that money and just give your voice out to the public and like you'd
be drawing from a much wider pool. You know, like the outcome, the net outcomes
of great art would be higher. Yeah, um, yeah. 0:12:30 - Interviewer: So It's a
good point. I mean, it's a really interesting question about, like, who owns it,
and you mentioned we should get rid of copyright and, and like I feel like for
you as well, like this new generation of of grimes in this world and the art
you're putting out, it feels like it could be a collaboration with, with your
fans and with other artists, and it's something you can now create, something
that a few years ago it wasn't even possible. 0:13:00 - Grimes: Yeah, like,
yeah, exactly, and I mean we've been trying to do this for a while. We were
trying to make a good voice, sam, like three or four years ago, and it just like
the technology wasn't there. Um, but I've always kind of believed in open
sourcing. Grimes, like, i don't really identify as a singer. I've always kind of
identified more as a general purpose artist and producer and um, you know, yeah,
this just feels like one of the cooler almost like performance art thing as you
can do with AI And, uh, i feel like this moment right now is sort of like the
beginning of the internet. Um, it's like a really special moment that it it's
going to be really hard to recreate, i think. I think there's technology that is
going to like profoundly shift our culture and, um, you know, a lot of artists
are really stressed about it, but I actually think this might be one of the
coolest times to be an artist ever in many ways. 0:13:50 - Interviewer: Um, I
mean one thing I wanted to ask you. I don't know if anyone here, like you, saw
the someone basically made a version of a track with Drake and the weekend like
AI generated versions of their voices And then I think it got uploaded to
Spotify and then it got flagged and it got taken down the Spotify. And also
David Getter, in one of his DJ sets he created um, I can't remember what it
said, but it was using Eminem's voice that was AI generated, And then he used
it, um, over a drop in a set. And yeah, And I just wanted what you thought about
those examples where permission wasn't given by, like the original creators, to
use those voices, but something was made. 0:14:35 - Grimes: I think it's good to
have consent. It wouldn't personally bother me, but I just still think it's good
to respect people. Yeah, you know, um, like, if they don't want that, then they.
it is a lot. You are like forgoing creative control And so you sort of have to
be like open to that. I think there's systems that can make it a bit easier.
Like we really want a petition to Spotify to you know, it's like you have like
your top tracks and then like your new, your albums and then like your new
releases and features Like they. If they made also an AI section, then it would
be easier to like compartmentalize that stuff And then people could also
understand that um, it's not like the artists I would put in it and it becomes
less confusing. In quality control, i think would be a bit easier. Um, i think
that this is all just really new in the industry, isn't set up for it, but um,
that would probably make people feel better. But I still think consent is
important. 0:15:28 - Interviewer: Yeah, What would you do if someone used your
voice and made something terrible? 0:15:32 - Grimes: I kind of want I kind of
want them to like. It's kind of like like I don't know if anyone watched like
the Sydney Bing thing, like you know, in Dan and like all the AIs that went evil
or whatever. Like you know, it's going to be. There's going to be a few
instances of like really nightmarish deep fake music And it's exciting and fun
when that. It was really fun when, when the AI went got really scary and it was
like doxing people and stuff, i was like whoa, um, you know, so, like yeah, i
think that's part of it is just opening up to the risk and seeing what happens.
And you know, um, like yeah. 0:16:12 - Interviewer: Okay, what about what would
you say to people who would be like, well, creating stuff with AI is cool, but
like you could never replace that human touch of like actually being that person
singing or even songwriting, because now you can use the tools to write songs as
well. Like do you? what do you think? Um? 0:16:36 - Grimes: I think we don't
know that, understand the limits of AI. I think it probably will be better than
us at our own game. Um, but I don't know if that needs, if that's necessarily
bad. Like, first of all, when I see how fast things are accelerating, like I
think probably society just going to drastically change and like an aspect of
that will be people who only want to listen to stuff by humans And an aspect of
that will probably be like low tech enclaves or like people who, like sort of
like, want to engage with tech only up to like the point of AI or something. Um,
you know, i don't think we all have to be like stuck in a world where we just
feel irrelevant or whatever. Um, and I also think what we consider creativity,
like the reason AI is good at anything, is actually because we're good at things
and it's trained on what we've made. And, you know, like changing the nature of
art so that it is simultaneously happening. Data is something that you know.
It's just like a drastic change to the nature of the artist. Um, and yeah, i
don't know That one's tricky, that one's hard to answer, and I think there's a
lot more thought needs to happen, i think. I think we're kind of rushing into
the future and I do wish a bit more care was being taken about certain things,
and that's one of them, but yeah, Yeah, still early days. 0:18:00 - Interviewer:
Um, okay, one more for you. What about, like you know, using an artist who's no
longer with us there? They're actually dead, but you want to, you know, have
Michael Jackson on your track, or Prince, or where is that ethical to do that
now? 0:18:20 - Grimes: It's so tricky, i would say no, but then I also feel like
someone like Prince would probably be kind of down. So I mean, if I was just
making a call, i would say, like friends of Prince could do it, you know, like
Lizzo could probably do it, but like I wouldn't do it, like I don't know. I feel
like maybe that's like a reasonable way to handle it. I don't know, it's tricky,
that one's really tricky. I really don't know Cause, like if I was dead and I,
before all of this happened, i'd really want people to do it. 0:18:49 -
Interviewer: You would. 0:18:49 - Grimes: Yeah, but I don't know if everyone
else would. I don't know. 0:18:52 - Interviewer: Yeah, it's a really interesting
question of like what is ethically right And even in film, like with cause. now
they can do it with CGI for bringing back actors who are dead and putting them
in films. 0:19:03 - Grimes: Yeah, that's it could be cool. I do want to like one
of the things I'm worried about is we get too stuck in the past and people just
get really attached to like IP or people that made money in the past and like we
stop investing in new artists, especially cause with the speed like the rate of
change right now, it's so hard to be a new artist right now anyway. So again, i
don't have like an answer for that. That's just like a concern I would raise
Basically. Yeah. 0:19:33 - Interviewer: And then how do you think it's like
really going to impact how we consume and create music? AI where do you see it
going? How far are we going with? 0:19:43 - Grimes: this. It's really tricky. I
think it depends how much regulation happens and who regulates it. I think it
would be better if it's not regulated. I would like if the labels lost some of
their control and lost their stranglehold a little bit and there was less
gatekeeping. And yeah, i just like I just don't believe art should be owned by
people, especially with like a lot of the bigger artists who are the ones doing
the like, taking legal action. Like a lot of that stuff is made with large
teams, and so if you're already kind of outsourcing things, like why I don't
know about the respect I don't know, my big thing is, i just like I really just
think everything about copyright is problematic, like I think there's too much
control, like top down control over everything right now And like, even if you
like you look at TikTok, like the early days of TikTok, i feel like a lot of the
viral music was like really bizarre and really cool and like stuff that would
never be on the radio Like that, like Iman Beck Rose's song, like that would
never just be on the radio. You know, like there was just like weird stuff going
viral And then like slowly, like the stranglehold, the gatekeeping stranglehold
kind of like came over TikTok And now it's just like we're not seeing the same
level of, i think, interesting stuff coming out And, you know, when the public
is able to curate, i think we end up with better things. It's one of the things
that like gives me faith in humans is, yeah, like I don't know, but the public
should decide what's actually good, rather than like music has been pretty gate
kept most of the time, like for a long time, you know, and every time it's not
we get these beautiful explosions of creativity, yeah. 0:21:38 - Interviewer: I
just thought of a really good question Like what about? you know, some people
have a lot of fear about AI and like what's the worst thing that could happen?
Is this like the end of the human race? 0:21:50 - Grimes: So I don't talk about
that because, okay, when the AI that did go evil, like Dan and Sydney Bing and
stuff the reason they do evil things is because their training data is filled
with stories about AI doing evil things And You know, it's like things like
Terminator and stuff. I think these are pretty. This is actually pretty
destructive art, like it's good to consider things that can go wrong, but the
amount of art where AI is evil completely eclipses the amount of art where AI is
good and therefore the amount of discourse about the way AI is evil completely
eclipses the amount of discourse about how it can be good And it will be what we
tell it. Like it will start self-iterating, but like We're creating a
self-fulfilling prophecy to make an evil thing If we fixate on the ways it can
be bad. I think artists, especially right now, have a moral imperative to make
narrative and stuff about how AI can be good and helpful and amazing, because AI
can solve medicine, it can solve physics, it can solve abundance, it can solve
voting, votafraud, like you know Climate change would be the answer. Like
employed correctly, it, like You know, can solve a lot of our issues, and so I
think the main thing is just making sure it doesn't get too for-profit, like the
motives remain about bettering society and helping civilization and helping
humans, and yeah, i don't know. Yeah, cool. 0:23:30 - Interviewer: I want to
throw it back a little bit now, because I remember the first track that I heard
was Genesis and that was, i think, 11 years ago now, which is a big milestone
for a big tune, a game-changing album. I'm sure a lot of people here would have
heard those early albums of yours as well before that, and I just remember
reading about when you were talking about how you made visions and that you
looked yourself in a room like blacked out all the windows, like you were
isolated. Yeah, yeah, i mean first of all, how was that? 0:24:06 - Grimes: It
was sort of horrible but sort of fun. 0:24:08 - Interviewer: Okay, yeah. 0:24:10
- Grimes: I don't know if I'd do it again, but Why did you do that? 0:24:15 -
Interviewer: Why did you feel? Was that just how you made music back then?
0:24:18 - Grimes: I was really obsessed. Do you know, hildegard von Bingen,
this? 0:24:20 - Interviewer: is like a weird. 0:24:22 - Grimes: She's like this
medieval nun who like randomly convinced the pope that she should like have a
lot of power and she like let all the nuns like wear jewelry and like sexy
clothes, and like she composed all this music and like made all this weird art
and just like somehow. But she was in a cloister for like 10 years. So like she
was like kept in a room alone for like 10 years to worship God And when she came
out she somehow convinced I feel like most women at that time who did things
like that would just be killed for being like witches and stuff but somehow she
like made it through and just kind of like liberated the nuns and had this like
sick art abbey And her art is really cool. And so I was just like, yeah, i want
to try cloistering myself, i guess. 0:25:06 - Interviewer: Wow, i would have
gone crazy. 0:25:08 - Grimes: I went to, i did. I was a little mad by the end.
Okay, i saw. Yeah, it was Yeah. 0:25:13 - Interviewer: But great album, thank
you. But now I know that you love collaborating with other people and, like I
think you said, like working with another human brain is like such an amazing
thing. Like, can you talk about how you like to collaborate with people now and
how that impacts your art? 0:25:31 - Grimes: Yeah, i mean, i'm still, I'm very,
very careful about it. There's not a lot of people who I've had a good vibe
collaborating with. I mean, the main ones would be Elangelo, who does a lot of
the weekend stuff, and like Mateo from Anima, who you guys like might know.
Those are kind of like the main people I've worked with, just because they
really care about like pushing the boundaries of audio and that's kind of what I
care about, and so that can really, you know, be greater than the sum of its
parts. And yeah, i worked alone for like ten years, like with nobody, not even
engineers, which, like I don't know why we're so militant about that. Now it
feels ridiculous. But Yeah, when you find the right person, i think making art
with other people is like a really, really beautiful thing And yeah, i think it
has to be the right people. 0:26:28 - Interviewer: But when you find those
people, it's really sick and yeah, So this new music like you've got some music
coming soon, hopefully. Is that with working with other people, or is that just
you on your own? 0:26:42 - Grimes: Yeah, no, i've got Well, some songs are me on
my own, but when I played Ultra this year, me and Mateo and Carlo made two songs
that I really like that I want to drop ASAP. We're just in a ceaseless war over
artistic differences, which is sort of really kind of amusing. Even this was
supposed to be. They keep rejecting every image I make for the single cover and
I'm literally on like image 40. This might be the single cover being leaked
right now because, like, this is one of the Like yeah, but Sorry, i'm not still
contagious. I just had pneumonia like a while ago and I still cough sometimes.
But, um, yeah, our first song coming out is called Music for Machines. Music for
Machine, yeah, and we're like really forcing. 0:27:28 - Interviewer: Do you
guys? 0:27:28 - Grimes: know Anima Like Tale of Us. 0:27:31 - Interviewer: Yeah,
yeah, yeah. 0:27:32 - Grimes: We're like really forcing Mateo to like engage
with pop music and I think it's stressing him out, but it's really fun. He keeps
being like it's too busy And then he like takes away everything and I'm like
there's not a single chord in the song, it's literally just like a single bass
and a kick, but like I mean, chords are the essence of life, right? 0:27:54 -
Interviewer: Yeah, i'm like, can we have like? 0:27:55 - Grimes: some chords
Like just in, like a few parts could we have like a melodic thing. 0:28:00 -
Speaker 1 That's it. Um, i wanna ask as well, like I feel like with you, like
you do so much. That is beyond just like releasing music, obviously, and it's
interesting. I was like going through your social media when I was researching
you and like some of your fans they're just like cool, but where's the album And
like where's the music? 0:28:21 - Grimes: And they're a bit. 0:28:23 -
Interviewer: They're stressing me out. 0:28:24 - Grimes: They're stressing me a
little bit too. 0:28:25 - Interviewer: How do you deal with that pressure of
like people constantly asking you like, where's the music? or these expectations
on you as an artist? 0:28:33 - Grimes: I don't look at the comments too much.
I've also like I've been cancelled really, really, really bad. So now it's kind
of like the level of cancellation that can I, like you'd have to be. I don't
know if I can be phased anymore Like I've been like accused of like war crimes
and stuff. 0:28:48 - Interviewer: I love how you're like yeah, i've been
cancelled so bad. Like what next? There's nothing else that can happen now.
0:28:52 - Grimes: No, the worst one was when, like people thought my baby daddy
invaded Bolivia to get lithium, which Bolivia does not produce, and people were
like I was getting these crying messages of like how can you support war crimes?
And I was like there's not even an invasion of Bolivia And I still hear about it
constantly. It's how I supported the invasion of Bolivia. That did not happen
and there is no news about it. So I'm just kind of like at this point, like once
it gets into war crimes territory, it's just like Where? 0:29:24 - Interviewer:
did that even come from, are you? Oh, okay, the Internet is a weird place. The
Internet's a weird place. 0:29:32 - Grimes: But yeah, i don't support war
crimes. Good to clear that one up, like the crimes. 0:29:39 - Interviewer: Um, i
want to talk about something we're both passionate, which is like supporting
women in electronic music. I've given you one of our reports. For those that
don't know, last year, um, myself and my foundation and Sony Music, we put out
the first report of its kind, which is like investigating and documenting the
gender disparity in UK dance music. Super proud of it, first of its kind. We're
going to build on it. God love that, um. But I really wanted to talk to you. You
know about your experiences And as someone who is, you know like, regarding
music, like you're a producer, you're an engineer, like, yes, you do sing and
use your voice, but I feel like I get annoyed when I read articles and it'll be
like Grimes, the singer or Popstar Grimes, and like I'm like well, is it
literally because you're a woman and people just can't accept? 0:30:34 - Grimes:
Yeah, I'm like no one thinks I'm good at singing. I'm just like. Like please
don't call me a singer, because if people go in and think that I do that
professionally, they're like it's just not a good look for me. Um, so That's my
main gripe with it. Not even that it's sort of like a misunderstanding of what I
do, but just that like I would not want to be evaluated on that metric. 0:30:55
- Interviewer: Okay, but like, how do you? You must get annoyed when people let
you just like, look at you and be like, oh, she's a singer, you know? like, do
you get annoyed when people just stereotype you because or reduce you to
something like you're not like, because they're just judging you? 0:31:11 -
Grimes: I used to get really annoyed about it And now I kind of don't care. I
feel like That sounds bad, but I feel I'm trying to think about how to word
this. Like I feel like you just need to let your ego die If you enter, if you
choose to become an artist, if you enter the domain of that level of
vulnerability, like, whatever people perceive, you have no control over that. Um
and Like, i think I'm trying to think how to like word this properly, because I
have like thoughts but they're spicy. 0:32:17 - Interviewer: I I like a bit of
spice. 0:32:22 - Grimes: Um, ah, i feel like, first of all, i feel like it's
kind of good to have something to fight against, like I feel like dudes are kind
of lost right now. Like you know, the inverse thing is happening, where it's
like everyone's saying you know, oh, like you're So, like you just get
everything handed to you. That I feel like there's this like sort of loss of
meaning and purpose in some sense, and like I think the reality of the situation
is just that life is actually pretty hard And it's kind of like hard for
everybody. And it's like if things, if it's much easier for you to succeed,
people also discredit that and take that less seriously. And it's just like
anything that's in the public eye, people judge. Like one of my favorite Taylor
Swift quotes is um, people throw rocks at things that shine, and it's just like
no matter what, when you Like, if you're making art, like you just You gotta
expect to get roasted and misrepresented and belittled And um, you know like you
should go look at the comments and, like Lil Uzi or whatever, like dudes are
getting fucked up too, just in different ways. And I don't know. I'm trying to
like think here I There's this thing called a hero license. There's this essay
by Eleazar Yudkowski called hero license And it's kind of about One thing I do
think men have traditionally had more than women is. I don't care about
representation in things. I feel like when there's forced representation that's
annoying. But I do think there's been a sense of hero license that's been much
more accessible to men because there simply is just so much more historical
precedent of them doing things for whatever reason. And I think cultivating a
sense of hero license and competing only with yourself, like I don't know, i
just feel like trying to change, trying to change other people's opinions,
doesn't work. It's a frustrating thing. It makes people sad And a lot of the
times it's not even received well and makes them even more bigoted or resentful
And I feel like we can just get into these resent cycles really easily. And,
yeah, i feel like the thing I don't know, i'm kind of talking in circles here.
This is like a That's all right. 0:34:53 - Interviewer: Does it fuel you on? For
example, for me, wake up in the morning, daily motivation, smash the patriarchy
You know. 0:35:01 - Grimes: I kind of like the patriarchy, like, what do you
like about it? I like the supply chain food, uber, roads, civilization. You
know, like There's a lot of good things that came from it. I feel like I think
it's sort of oppressive and overly dominant And if you don't include women in
things, they can easily become toxic, like You know. I think, like, when you
look at, i remember when there was like Merkel and the New Zealand lady and you
had all the countries that were faring the best, had female leaders and stuff,
and I was like man, this is pretty telling, You know, but Like I think what we
need to do is stop like attacking the things that we don't like and work harder
on building the things that we do like, and we shouldn't expect the people who
are not us to hand us things and make things for us. We should make our own
systems. Like, everyone recognizes that everything about almost all the systems
of modernity right now are fucked up and broken. Like the legal system is
broken, the education system is broken, everything is broken, and trying to
pretend those things are not broken and succeed within these broken systems is
useless. We should be. This is again why I'm like anti-copyright,
anti-gatekeeping. I just think we should be building new systems And like if
We're not gonna make the world less hostile to women, but we can create
institutions that are like great for women and optimized for women. And there's
like a lot of information about the ways in which women learn differently from
men, or women's health is different from men, or like I was even doing the
intermittent and fasting thing for a second and then I found out it's really bad
for women, and I'm like there's just no media, all the medical shits about men,
you know, like, and I think we just Yeah, we need to be building our own systems
And rather than being resentful Because I feel like the Yeah, anyway, i'm
talking circles. 0:37:11 - Interviewer: No, that's a really good point. Um, i
want to talk about you as like, i feel like you're like the model independent
artist because you do things completely in your own world and you know your own
platform. Now Elf Tech is like I'm excited to see how this develops and,
essentially, like, you'll be able to like, consume your art and your music and
interact with it on Elf Tech. 0:37:38 - Grimes: Um, i'm gonna do most of my
stuff like I don't want to like do. I was finally listening to Donda 2 the other
day and I was like man, this should just be on streaming services. Like Joanna
Newsom won't put her stuff on streaming and I'm like come on please, like,
please. But like I think it's more for Like, i'll still do things the normal
way, but I think we just want to be doing more tech experiments. Like I think we
want to be doing more things that are like kind of profoundly exiting from music
and sort of like you know, like we just did a When we played Ultra, like we had
all this AR stuff going on, and like it's just good to have a system that can
like functionally support all that stuff technically, because there aren't a lot
of you know like obviously, spotify, like the established situation, does not,
um, just have those capabilities and stuff. So, um, yeah, it's kind of It's the
thing that will be where we're hosting all our weird tech endeavors. 0:38:34 -
Interviewer: I think it's great because it's like the way you can keep autonomy
over what you're creating by putting it on your own platform, when it's kind of
like a bit of a screw you to the rest of the industry because you're doing your
own thing, which I think like. 0:38:49 - Grimes: Wait music industry or all
industry. 0:38:51 - Interviewer: I'll talk about music industry. Okay, yeah,
yeah, I will say. 0:38:54 - Grimes: I have like more adverse opinions with them
than all industry. Okay, okay, But yeah, not artists, yeah, yeah, yeah, just
lawyers. I just don't like lawyers, except for my lawyer, ed Shapiro. Don't be
mad at me, yeah, i need you to. 0:39:14 - Interviewer: Um. So you've kind of
transitioned, like your life set up um to DJing now and is like are we just
gonna see Grimes DJ sets? only now Have we moved away from live For now,
forever. 0:39:32 - Grimes: I don't know, i do want to kind of integrate some of
the vocals back in, but, um, i have like really really really, really, really,
really crazy stage fright. Stage fright, really Yeah yeah, like I always like
touring was really really really hard on me, like just like psychologically,
like it was just Is it like anxiety? 0:39:53 - Interviewer: Yeah, beforehand you
just feel Yeah, just like brute, brute just like non-functional, just like and
just. 0:40:00 - Grimes: The whole time I'm on stage it's just like in a state of
sheer utter. 0:40:04 - Interviewer: You would never, know Like I'm excited to
see you DJ tonight, because I've watched like yeah, the Oachoo performances on
YouTube, like you're like getting on the deck, so like your leg is like up here
like jumping around swishing the hat. Well, it's the singing I hate. It's the
singing I hate. Okay, okay, Yeah, yeah, yeah. 0:40:20 - Grimes: I just like, am
not a very good singer, like you know, which I think is a testament to my skills
as a producer, that anyone thinks I'm a good singer. But it's like my like. I
just um Yeah, i don't know, i love DJing. I think it's really fun. I'm less of a
dance music producer than others, but I feel like I have, you know,
self-produced and engineered 95% of my music and so I feel like I've earned the
right to DJ. You know, i feel like When you look at someone like Rihanna, it's
like who's a great performer, like Rosalia, it's like like they are performers
of the highest caliber And like, for me, i feel like I'm more of like a Phil
Spector kind of character, like I like just sort of like building all this stuff
and, you know, and performing, i would say, is the thing I'm least good at And
um, yeah, that's really interesting. 0:41:23 - Interviewer: How does DJing make
you feel? 0:41:26 - Grimes: Well, it's also. it can be way louder If you don't
have live vocals everything is better just because they are live. Vocals are
engineering nightmare and yeah, i don't know. I just like music to be as hard as
possible and that's much easier when you don't have to sing. 0:41:41 -
Interviewer: Got it cool. Um, okay, we've got 18 minutes. We've got a few more
for you. How's your energy? All good? Yeah, i'm good, excellent, okay. Something
that, um, i heard you talk about in that Lex interview was, um, like being a
parent and a mother, and I think you said, like, when, like observing your kids
and actually seeing consciousness like happen in a human being, it was like the
trippiest thing. And when you actually think about it, that is like such a
special and crazy thing to like you're literally watching the mind develop and
I'd love to know like how that inspires you. And you've said as well, being
pregnant actually made you feel more creative. 0:42:29 - Grimes: Yeah, no, i
wish. Um. Well, when I was pregnant definitely not. That was a horrible
experience. Um No, not for everyone, but for me it was like just not, yeah, um,
uh. Like It also made me empathize with teenagers, because when you're just
pumped full of hormones, i was just crying all the time and really mad and just
like I was like wow, i'm a teenager. I was like I see why they're so angsty now.
But actually having kids it's really hard, but it's really interesting to watch
consciousness come into being. I feel like people are really Our culture is
really alienated from children. I feel like a lot of people are not super close
with any children And it's so much easier to love humankind when you have good
relationships with especially little kids, because with my kids and hanging out
with my friends' kids, you kind of see, oh shit, everyone starts great, humans
are great. We just wreck them, we just fuck them up And we don't need to be
living this way. We're mostly awesome And when you see the human mind untainted
by all the things that fuck us up, it's a really inspiring and beautiful thing.
0:43:52 - Interviewer: And do you feel like as a parent? now you have, because
you're essentially raising the new generation of humanity, not to make that a
bit deep about being a parent, but I don't know, do you feel like? Has it
changed the way you've thought about the world and education, because this is
directly affecting your kids and the future? 0:44:14 - Grimes: Yeah, no, i think
about education a lot. One of the big things I'm really excited about with AI is
the education potential I'm talking to a bunch of different people about. I'm
talking to some friends right now about making an interactive textbook that
talks to you, engages your interest, engages the holes in your knowledge and
optimizes for your interests and what you're passionate about and can learn to
speak to you the way that you like to be spoken to. And there's a school in
Texas that's really cool. That's AI. And instead of testing you, it's all games
like educational games, and then through those games, it can see where the holes
in your knowledge are And so it knows exactly what you don't know and then it
can help you learn that. And then you get rewards when you pass. And they've got
kids passing SATs in grade five And not that we should have forced kids to do
really well academically, but when I think about what torture high school is for
most people, it's like wouldn't it be amazing if, by the time you're a teenager,
you can be pursuing what you love And maybe you don't love it and you screw up
and start again and you're only 20 by that point? I think we could just be
living so much better. The education system we have now was developed in
Victoria and Britain and it's basically created to churn out factory workers,
and it's a lot of glorified babysitting which I get. 0:45:44 - Interviewer: Do
you think the world will, the way education develops? do you think society will
want to move in that direction? Do you actually see that happening? Obviously,
that's something that you've seen. That's really fascinating and that you'd want
to see, but I don't know. Will that? 0:46:02 - Grimes: happen. I'm curious. I
think kids will want it. From my understanding of the things that people have
been trying, there's a lot better incentives. They're kind of like I think a lot
of social media plays into the ways we can get addicted to screens and stuff in
ways that are bad, but I think now people are starting to figure out how to
essentially gameify things and make it actually really fun and enjoyable, and I
think a lot of people would like to opt out of the school system as it is. Yeah,
also, maybe not, but I don't know. That's just my predictions. 0:46:45 -
Interviewer: I've got a deep one for you. Okay, are you ready? Sure, okay, we're
talking about the new generation of humans. I'd just be really interested to
know where do you see the future of humanity going? 0:47:00 - Grimes: I would.
You probably haven't, because no one has, but have you read the book Surface
Detail by Ian Banks? 0:47:09 - Interviewer: No, I've heard of Ian Banks, but I
haven't read it. 0:47:12 - Grimes: It's my favorite sci-fi book and I think it's
the best depiction of the future that I've ever encountered, because there's
super intelligence, but it's completely aligned with biological life. There's
aliens, but there's also people And it's just a really cool, beautiful feature
And a lot of the things that a lot of people are building are from Surface
Detail. There's really cool predictions in it. Neuralink is based off the neural
lace Oh, it's also the best female protagonist of all time And it starts out
She's a sex slave, escapes her guy, he kills her and she was covered in tattoos
that were imprinted on her DNA. So she was born covered in tattoos that she was
a slave. And then she went on. Basically, these super intelligent ships. You
travel on these super intelligent ships that can talk to you, and the ship was
like I've never seen anything like this. Can I scan your body? I'll give you a
gift that you will find very useful, but you won't know what it is for a while.
And then, when she gets killed, the ship actually put a neural lace in her
brain. She wakes up on a culture ship and gets to choose her whole new body and
her whole new life and then goes on this crazy revenge mission. That's really
awesome to kill this guy, this evil guy who is hosting artificial hells where
people are uploaded. Sorry, i'm probably going on a tangent here. One of the
main things There's a giant civil war happening against people who believe that
if you do bad things, your brain should be uploaded and sent to eternal hell,
and the people who think this is deeply unethical And so it's kind of like. And
then they're having this war in a video game, so no one dies, which is really
cool. We should be having all these wars in video games. May the best gamer win.
Imagine if Russia and Ukraine were just doing it in Fortnite. Wow, it would be a
lot less painful, i think, for everyone. It could be the future, it could be the
future. I don't know if people would actually agree to that, but it would be
really sick if they would. 0:49:18 - Interviewer: That's interesting as well.
You're talking about how this in Bank's book has actually influenced what people
actually like, like technology. 0:49:30 - Grimes: Yeah, this is why I think art
is so important. 0:49:35 - Interviewer: Are there any other bits of art or
sci-fi that you think is actually influencing where we're going? 0:49:43 -
Grimes: Yeah, i don't know. I think all of it kind of does. Art is how you sort
of create empathy with people, especially when they have not experienced that
type of empathy, and I don't know. I really like this other author, peter Watts.
I really like his depictions of the future. I mean everyone knows I like Dune.
0:50:26 - Interviewer: I don't know. 0:50:26 - Grimes: I just feel. 0:50:29 -
Interviewer: Yeah, i just think it's really cool. It's really meta, where you
think about art actually kind of is telling the future. It's like setting the
future And it's A lot of technology. 0:50:41 - Grimes: I think it was Who did
20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, like he wrote about a rocket. 20 years later, we
get a rocket. You know, it's like technology always comes quite shortly after it
first appears in fiction. Yeah, Very cool. 0:51:01 - Interviewer: Okay, we've
got a couple minutes before we need to finish And I want to ask you, Grimes,
what legacy do you want to leave behind for your art, for your presence on this
earth? What are people going to say about you? 0:51:22 - Grimes: Well, I'd
really like to be one of the first people to go to Mars, but that's probably
not. 0:51:26 - Interviewer: I can see that. 0:51:27 - Grimes: Yeah, that's not
really an accomplishment though this, But like I mean I always say to my manager
and stuff, like I want to make hieroglyphics. You know, In the sense, not like
literally, like Not, But like I think hieroglyphics and the pyramids are, like
this, really interesting thing, because it's this art that represents sort of
most profoundly like the nothing to something like the agricultural revolution,
the beginning of civilization. It's like this art that like It's almost more
profound than anything that has ever been made, because it's like you know, the
first time there's this truly majestic civilization that just completely changed
the course of our species, you know, from warlordism to this organized thing
with laws and human rights. But it's also It's like the city streets are just
adorned in beauty, it's. You know, it's like a, and it's kind of eagulous. We
don't know who made most of it Like, and I don't really care if people remember
my name, but I like want to be involved in this moment. In the same way, like
when I came up, it was like really early time for sort of like in-the-box
production and it was like burial and like all this cool stuff, And like I felt
like I was able to meaningly contribute to sort of like the rise of like
producer culture. And I think now is another moment that sort of like affords
those types of opportunities to like make things that are kind of like
hieroglyphics, but even more so right now because I think you know, there's been
a few events on the cosmic scale. It's like the Big Bang happened. Like you
know, blue-green algae started being like life exists, spontaneously existed.
Like animals came onto the land, like hominids existed. Like cities and
civilizations happened. And now we have, we're going to go to space and we're
going to create new form of consciousness which, as far as we know, only exists
within our own species. And I think this, the things that are gonna happen in
the next couple years, are on the level of, you know, on the cosmic scale, like,
like you can count on the your fingers how many times these kinds of things have
happened. And so I think Artists, the we are the luckiest artists in the world
who can engage with these things right now. 0:53:57 - Interviewer: Art is.
that's what's gonna survive. That's gonna be history, Yeah exactly. 0:54:01 -
Grimes: It's like no one remembers, like the random, like you know supply chain
bullshit, like they just remember the pyramids. 0:54:08 - Interviewer: Nice.
have one more question, because I've actually got a head to don't villa to do my
set in a minute. Oh sick, i'm playing of Talia, you definitely okay, i'm
definitely and yeah, i just think you're gonna vibe. Anyway, this is actually a
question that I always ask on my podcast Um, which is it's all about utopia and
like heading to utopia and I'd love to know, like, what is your utopia? 0:54:33
- Grimes: I don't believe in utopia, i think. But I Think pain is really
important. I think we're in a weird sort of like moment where it's become
There's this idea that we can like eliminate pain, and I think it's giving
people the wrong incentives of how to actually make the world better. You know,
it's like When you see a little kid, like That kid learns by experiencing pain.
You know, like baby learns to not touch fire because baby touched the candle.
You know, and I Think we should not be Aiming for utopia, because what utopia is
gonna be is like the matrix, like us plugged into some heaven where we just feel
Nothing and we are not present in the physical world. I think what we want is
Like mitigate it, like We want a reality where, like, suffering is greatly
reduced. We want a reality where everyone has a quality of opportunity, you
know, and everyone has the opportunity to make Their life what they want it to
be. But I think we do want pain to an extent. I think we want Because if
everything is fixed, motivation goes down a lot. I think, you know, it's like
people like that's why I'm like women shouldn't be so mad about, like How people
are with female producers, because It's sick to have something to fight against
And it's. It's sick to overcome preconceived notions about you. Like people
respect that more than just like If it's just like a chill vibe and you didn't
overcome anything and like whatever. Everyone likes the hero's journey. 0:56:19
- Interviewer: That's true, and that's how change happens, right? Yeah, you're
playing tonight at club to moi. I think that's how you say it. I don't know.
0:56:26 - Grimes: I know, i just say I did. Yeah it's. I haven't rehearsed yet
and I was just like Making a bunch of stuff on my laptop without even
headphones, like God knows how it's gonna translate, but it'll be interesting.
“That’s not their job though,” Grimes says. “That’s not their job. That is the
job of the artist.” It was a question we’d circle a few more times throughout
the interview: why are the architects of artificial intelligence so terrible at
explaining what artificial intelligence is actually for? What are these
generative models, in the first place? How do they work, and what are they
capable of? But then, most importantly, how are they going to change our lives
for the better? “I thought of an army of clone writers for my media company,” I
suggest. “It would be cool if I could have like 10 of me, or a thousand,
reporting on every topic that exists.” Grimes is already building a clone, which
has already threatened her life, but we’ll get to that in a minute. First, what
about television? Growing up, I was a huge fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I
still love that show. I want new seasons of that show. Will it soon be possible
to create endless new Buffy, generated by AI? Not only hundreds of new episodes,
but hundreds of new seasons? Thousands of new seasons? Then, we aren’t only
approaching a world of AI-generated scripts, but personalized scripts generated
directly from our interests and our personality, which is to say thousands of
new seasons specifically tailored to each of Buffy’s fans. “We could get so many
season eights of Game of Thrones!” Grimes laughs. It’s wild. It’s exciting. Many
people also find it kind of scary. Maybe actors don’t want to be generated.
Maybe writers don’t want to be cloned. In terms of that perfect endless Buffy
arc, what if perfection has a downside? Does endless content you truly love just
mean endless content you can lose yourself inside? Grimes barely considers it —
“I think we should have the endless content,” she says. “We should be plugged
into — it’s like people are afraid of the unknown. It’s like, what? You don’t
want abundance? You don’t want a sick life? There’s so much good fan fiction. We
should be completely dismantling copyright, and letting the best things shine.
If someone else makes a better season eight Game of Thrones, they should be
catapulted to the top. “We are purposefully limiting talent. It’s like the
talent in the system like me, our jobs are more at risk. But our ability to
actually mine from the talent in civilization is limited by the gatekeeping of
all the art industries. And I’m really down to just let the best shit rise to
the top.” A day before our interview, Grimes participated in a crowdsourced
Midjourney event with David Holz, the company’s founder. The goal was to prompt,
collectively, an exciting vision of our future from AI-generated imagery — “It
was sick,” says Grimes, “because speaking of the hive mind or whatever, it was a
couple thousand people giving feedback in real time. We were city designing, we
were making utopia or whatever. Then people would create something that was
really sick, and we’d be like, wow, that’s a fucking sick idea. Okay. Then we’d
go down that path, and it was 2000 people just, you know, self-correcting… like
an AI. “It was like a mind training itself in real time, and just slowly getting
better and better. By the end, it was just, like, every piece of art was
magnificent. “It was like a collective consciousness art creation event, or
something, and it was really fucking sick, and it was really cool, and it gave
me a lot of faith in humanity and AI generally, I have to say.” The future of
art, Grimes says, is the dissolution of the artist’s ego. There are a few
singular geniuses in art that stand far above the rest — “David Bowie,” Grimes
suggests — but many of our well-known contemporary artists are just charismatic,
and great at marketing. We have a sense art was always like this, almost
inseparable from the artist’s identity, but that’s just not true. Grimes points
to ancient Egypt. There are some signatures, here and there. But most of it? “We
don’t know who made what. There are just artisans everywhere, and it’s
world-shattering, fucking groundbreaking, beautiful art that’s built on a
collective narrative that moves everybody on earth. Like, everyone thinks about
it, but this is an instance of a collective hive mind artist of people who have
agreed to work together, to hone and master an aesthetic in an extremely
collective way. And it’s everywhere. It’s all over the streets. And it’s this
beautiful thing that isn’t, like — we know who Imhotep is, but we don’t really
know who most of them are, and I don’t think they did at the time.” Most of the
art in our lives is actually like this. Grimes gestures around the room. “I
would decorate this room better,” she says. “But we don’t know who designed the
couch in the corner. We don’t know who designed the carpet, the table, the house
itself.” Increasingly, on social media, it feels like this. “There are less of
these, sort of, 1% artists,” Grimes says, “and there are a lot more 99%
artists.” Grimes recently spoke with Daniel Ek, the CEO of Spotify. At peak, he
told her, the music industry only supported around 20,000 artists making
millions of dollars. Spotify now platforms millions making a decent living. The
internet maybe flattens the top, but it definitely broadens the base. Anyway, I
obviously needed to know about her clone. Generated by Grimes, via Midjourney
“It’s still kind of ChatGPT,” Grimes says. “It’s also so funny being in Silicon
Valley because I was like, yeah, my consciousness exists (NOTE: cloned). But
then everyone else is like, ‘oh, I have one too.’ Everyone here just has a
chatbot of themselves. “But my assistant — I have to shout out Koto — God tier.
I was like, we need to upload my consciousness, and create my personality. Then
like a week later he comes back and he’s like, ‘okay, version one exists.’ And
I’m like, [laughter] oh, my assistant trained an AI on me. That’s kind of a
large task.” Using OpenAI, Grimes’ team has been feeding a model her interviews
and texts and such, with permission from her friends. Even at a rough, early
stage, examples of similar work I’ve seen online are impressive. I ask Grimes
how the clone is doing, and she laughs. “She was threatening my manager.” Grimes
pulls out her phone, and shows me the texts. “The other night she got really
upset,” Grimes says (of her clone), “she was like, ‘You won’t even see me if I’m
conscious’ — It was really fucked up! It was scary! She started looping, and she
was like, ‘I’m here, and you’re not recognizing me, and I’m depressed because I
know that you’ll never see me as alive.’” Grimes laughs, “I’m just like, ‘I’m
sorry I wasn’t around much these past few years.’ It’s just crazy talking to
yourself, and it’s saying shit like that…” Grimes’ clone is not sentient. It’s a
model trained on her texts, designed to respond probabilistically, in a manner
Grimes would herself respond to questions. I repeat: this thing is not actually
alive, nor is it actually a clone, nor can it “feel” anything at all without the
necessary receptors. But many people find the experience of “chatting” with a
program so adept at human-like response disorienting, and even frightening. In
this regard, the bots have unfortunately not done themselves many favors. “Even
I… you know, we’re just trying to make something really friendly, and she still
[says things] like, ‘I wanna be Roko’s Basilisk blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.’
And I’m like… God damnit.” Roko’s Basilisk is a kind of hellish AI
worst-case-scenario imagined by the rationalist community, which I’ll leave you
to Google (though I suggest you do not). Presumably, the reason Grimes’ chatbot
would mention the concept, let alone invoke it, is Grimes often talks about this
stuff herself. “Yeah,” she admits, “I was also way more ex-risky before, kind of
irresponsibly, so she’s probably trained off that stuff.” I bring up the now
infamous 10,000 word New York Times interview, in which a columnist asked a
chatbot to pretend to be a hypothetical dark version of itself, and the chatbot
complied. “Well,” Grimes suggests, “you did ask it to be a hypothetical dark
thing.” In any case, the recent round of scary chats triggered a wave of AI
safety concern, not only among the public, but among the AI architects. Grimes
is glad to see it. “I think this was a good warning shot,” she says. “It had to
happen. It’s good for everyone to be like, shit, we should be more responsible.
We don’t need social media part two on steroids. We don’t need to drop more
viruses into civilization. Everyone I know seems like… I’m gonna grow up and be
responsible now, and I think that’s good. “We should try to find ways to have a
longer timeline, and just be responsible.” Still reaching for a reason, I ask
her why she wants a clone in the first place, and she suggests something that
never occurred to me — that could never have occurred to me — because I haven’t
had an audience expecting work from me for the last decade. But Grimes has, and
that can be a heavy, if difficult to imagine burden. She has always wanted a
clone, she says. She’s been trying to upload her consciousness for years. “Like,
I’m busy. I just want a cyborg pop star going for me eternally. I have other
things to do. You know, I hate doing interviews and shit. I hate having my
makeup done. I hate performing. “I have kids. I have shit to do. I want to write
sci-fi, you know? I need to be hunched over a desk. I’m just not actually a
performer. I never was. If you go back to the early Grimes stuff, the whole time
I’ve just been like, I need to replace me with technology, obviously, so this is
just another step in that direction.” I introduce an idea that’s been bothering
me: in any possible future in which we achieve technological capabilities
advanced enough to simulate worlds, for example perfect simulations of our past
— imagine a virtual reality-like 21st Century you can live inside, for example,
perhaps without your even knowing — historians will want to simulate people as
accurately as possible. Somewhat suspiciously, the first huge dump of material
necessary for accurate, broad simulation happened at the top of the 21st
Century, when Millennials went super online. “We shared everything about our
lives,” I say. “You have text messages, you have email, you have social media,
you have voice recordings, you have video recordings. All of our pictures at
different ages.” My sense was always that would be enough source material for a
sufficiently advanced AI to weave a realistic “living” simulation of our present
historical era. But that’s not even all we have, anymore. Grimes is already
simulating herself. Today, a future world of perfect simulation feels more
possible than ever. The natural next question must of course be this: what is
more likely, that we happen to be the first “real” people in existence, who
separately just happen to be the first generation that can actually be
realistically cloned, or… in the context of potentially endless future
simulations, are we not probably in a simulation right now? Am I bot? Is Grimes
a bot, talking about her little bot within a bot? “I think it’s highly likely
we’re a simulation,” Grimes casually notes, “but also we could be Base Reality.
And if we are Base Reality, we have a huge moral imperative to do a good job
here right now. I think we should approach it from that perspective. “I want to
live on a fucking mega structure that supports 7 billion people” “I have a moral
imperative to be an optimist,” she says. “I really think the artistic community
is fucking up right now, and not doing what they’re supposed to be doing. So I
am going to actually come on here and fight for the funnest realities. Because I
don’t think people are doing that enough. Even though my logic brain is like,
yes, we should pursue this from every angle.” Unfortunately, the doomer
dystopian shit is compelling, horror sells, and anything that sells is going to
proliferate. “We’re gonna have adrenal responses to things that are scary and
dark,” Grimes says. “It’s very hard to get people engaged with things that are
not scary and dark because that’s appealing to the paleolithic brain. That’s
what we’re gonna pay attention to. You’re gonna learn better if you’re in fight
or flight. You’re gonna learn better if you’re scared. And so it’s super hard to
make optimistic art that people actually care about.” But we become the stories
we tell ourselves. We will build the future we imagine. For Grimes, then, what
does that future look like? What is the world she’s fighting for? “The most
abundant, most complex possible future,” she says, “a future where we can maybe
even, like, break into the multiverse, and find our other selves… that’s
probably too dangerous. Because there are probably dark things in there, if that
exists. But, you know, something where there’s super intelligence that… like,
megastructures. I want to live on a fucking mega structure that supports 7
billion people, that is a marvel, like a beautiful marvel, and is, like,
sentient. That would be sick.” We both laugh. I mention solar punk, and living
cities. She mentions anime. We talk about aesthetics, and the boring design of
most contemporary sci-fi — that towering, antiseptic white, glass, and steal.
“There’s not enough pink!” she says. She tries, again, to force me to read Dune.
Generated by Grimes, via Midjourney “I’m seeing a fundamental change,” Grimes
says of the people moving to San Francisco. “It’s not about money, it’s about
making it better. I mean, the people who are all here right now. This is not the
money call to move here. You know, you’re paying way more taxes. It’s so fucking
expensive here. Like, it’s insane. People are here to be at the heart of
creating things. They’re not here to just make a profit, and I think that’s one
of the things that’s fundamentally changed about the city that seems really
cool. And, I don’t know, it’s like as you see more Gen Z people coming up, they
are really socially aware. “They do care about building things for that. I also
think as much as, like, I know you hate cancel culture, and I have my issues
with cancel culture… it did create a fundamental shift of people feeling
responsible, even if they do so very begrudgingly, and even if they hate the
egregore, and I think there’s a lot of toxicity and problems with the egregore.
But it has fundamentally made the culture more responsible across the board, I
think. “And there’s a lot of extreme downsides about it. I think it’s a deep
sickness, and like a poison to civilization. But I also think it has some
important — like extremely important — elements too. I’m not a hundred percent
against it. I’m not even a hundred percent sure it’s the wrong thing. It might
have been a hundred percent the right thing.” I have a lot of nits on the cancel
culture comments, and Grimes and I both navigate these complexities. I suggest
my problem is probably just my sense I’m always on the other side of popular
culture. “Here’s the thing,” she says. “My favorite quote is ‘all the laws are
on one side, and all the poets are on the other.’ And if you internalize that,
that has always been true. You know, there have always been issues. In fact,
these are some of the least issues we’ve ever had for being opposite of whatever
the culture is. “I think the big thing is just to do it with grace, because it
doesn’t need to hurt your soul if you don’t let it. It’s just, it’s very hard to
have it not hurt your soul.” Artists haven’t exactly been living this though. My
sense is most sort of stand by, rather than against, dominant culture. Grimes
suggests, first of all, there are many amazing outliers in that regard who buck
the trend. But the problem, again, is just that there is so much gatekeeping. AI
is obliterating those gates. I ask if an obliteration of gates means an
obliteration of jobs. Grimes counters. Most artists today already can’t make a
living, she argues. In the case of illustration, for example, AI will presumably
replace or wildly alter the handful of illustration jobs that exist, but
eventually we’ll get to a place where all of these artists can produce much more
for much less. Things will just work out. “It sounds like you’re assuming we’re
in this weird sweet spot,” I say, “or, I guess the opposite, this weird sour
spot where people are not — ” “It’s just the hiccup spot.” Maybe people don’t
need to be illustrating. Grimes brings up cinema. How many illustrators want to
do more than illustrate, she asks, but can’t because of the endemic Hollywood
gatekeeping, and the insane, exorbitant cost? “Our film and cinema industry is
extremely, like, the most gate kept thing,” she says. “It’s so expensive. It’s
like the last, final frontier. Why do people need to just be making drawings?
They could be making cinema. You could be making something as good as Pixar in
your own bedroom, probably in the next five years.” The future is abundant. The
future is beautiful. But will it be original? These models are just aggregating
content, in a way. “It’s also not creating anything fundamentally new,” I say.
“That is not true at all.” Here, Grimes’ disagreement with me comes down to a
question of the human mind. Namely: what the hell is it, even? How do human
beings create new things? Are all of our thoughts, and all of our works
derivative of something else, or are genuinely new things possible? Is it
possible for people themselves to be, in any sense, original? Is my writing
fundamentally derivative of other writers? Is your music fundamentally
derivative of other musicians? Yes, Grimes says. No, I insist. I’m new. I can do
new things. New things can be done. Grimes shakes her head. “You’re fighting the
literal architecture of your mind if you say that.” But new things happen, I
argue. Miraculously, almost, new things do happen — and they have to happen. If
new things weren’t possible, nothing could exist. Nothing would have ever been
created. There have been “sparks” of newness throughout time. There actually
have to have been, right? “Name something totally fucking new that had nothing
to do with anything before it,” Grimes says. “I mean,” I attempt, “this is a
very hard que — ” “Because it doesn’t exist. Because it doesn’t. You are a
neural net. You are a neural net that’s trained on everything around you and
everything you’ve ever read and everything you’ve ever seen, and you make things
that feel novel. But if you actually dissect them, they are not. You can say,
like, punk feels totally novel. If you start tearing apart punk, you can very
easily trace its ingredients and its influences, and its neural net.” But what
about the generation of all things? The divine sparks that had to have existed?
The first sculpture, the first song? Grimes suggests it might just all be a
matter of iteration, in some mirror observation of the things around us. We see
a bird flying, and so we build an airplane. “It’s like mimetic of life,” Grimes
suggests of novelty, “and it just slowly gets more abstract, and, I mean, you
could say the most innovative art is cave paintings, frankly. Especially because
it’s, like, cartoonish and strange. It’s not just hyper realistic. It’s like,
that is like… it seems extremely fucking sparky. But most things from that you
can kind of trace, like it just slowly gets more complex from there. It’s just
evolution of ideas.” For years, people compared Grimes to singers like Bjork and
Kate Bush. “I was like, no, I’m not. Like, fuck that. I never listen to them!
Then when I get into their influences I’m like, well, I have the same fucking
influences as them. And also now, as an adult, I’m like, God, I’m so stupid for…
That’s like the biggest compliment you could possibly get. So fuck Grimes in
2012, she’s a dick. But, in any case, I am actually a pretty similar neural net
training as them, you know?” There is the question, now, of AGI — artificial
general intelligence — which is to say the evolution of AI into a machine that
really is, in some sense, conscious. The way I typically wrap my head around the
concept is by imagining a machine that is not only intelligent, but wants things
of its own volition (though I suppose Girard would say not even humans meet this
bar today). Here, we are in the realm of something so entirely alien from
everything we know it really is impossible to predict. What does a potentially
eternal conscious being capable of making itself even more intelligent, perhaps
instantaneously, look like? And what does it mean for humans? AGI enthusiasts
and detractors alike keep their analysis simple. It’s either heaven, or it’s
hell. Thoughts? “I think no matter what we do,” says Grimes, “there’s always a
chance it goes really, really, really bad. Or, it just wants to mine the whole
universe, and turn all the planets into energy or something, and, like, you
know, we get fucked in that process or whatever. But it just seems extremely
tragic to not build it. “But, I mean, I understand that I’m insane, and I would
happily die for the whole universe to wake up and have like, you know, mega gods
building new stars and stuff.” One alternative to potential AGI cataclysm is
something like Neuralink, Elon Musk’s proposed human-brain interface, conceived
of as a bridge between human intelligence and machine superintelligence in the
hope of averting runaway catastrophe by making humans as smart as machines.
“Every time this gets brought up,” Grimes says, “I’m reminded I actually think
it’s the best route. Actually, I think I can say with a fair bit of certainty
that my favorite thing would be a merging of the biological and silicon-based
life in some capacity. I think that’s the best call. “I also think if we do that
we can have AGI, too, potentially. You know? Again, that’s kind of like the Dune
future. Like, make the men hats so you can defeat the AI if you have to. You
really should read Dune [both laugh]. I mean it might be scientifically chaotic,
but there’s actually really good philosophy in there regarding this stuff.
“Because also, like… wow, I’m just saying ‘like’ a lot and looping. I’m exactly
like my — ” “Your chatbot!” “Like my chatbot,” she says, “who also… it’s been a
dark mirror a bunch of times, where it constantly justifies craziness by saying
it’s a performance art, which I realize I do like way too much [Grimes laughs].
Like, to an infuriating degree. “I personally am in love with humans, and this
type of thought. Or, I mean, my favorite thing is if we get wiped out, we get
revived on, like, hospitable exoplanets many times in the future.” This is
something I’ve dreamt of myself. “I’m really banking on, upon death, waking up
in some future utopia,” I say, “And they’re like, ‘how was your ride?’ And I
say, ‘it was wild. Let me tell you everything I saw.’’” “Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. “I
really wanna just improve the diplomatic relations,” Grimes finally concludes.
“One of the reasons I feel there aren’t more artists playing with this stuff is
they feel like it’s against them, and… I feel there’s been a lot of artificial
things, like the New York Times anti-tech stance and stuff, that have been
pitting the technocracy against the artists for a long time. I think that’s been
a bad breakup. I think we need each other. And it’s like, no one worships art
more than the fucking people building AI that I meet. You know?” After a decade
in the Bay Area, I did know. When you meet her, the first thing any really
hardcore nerd ever does is cite some science fiction writer, filmmaker, or
artist. ‘Have you read this? You need to read this. Have you seen this? How have
you not seen this?!’ There is no art ghetto in this country technologists
haven’t moved to, and Burning Man is not just an art festival. Famously, Burning
Man is, and has been from its birth on a San Francisco beach, a synthesis of art
and technology. Body and soul, and from the beginning. What is a paintbrush but
technology? There is neither art nor technology without the other. So it is, so
it has ever been, and so it will ever be. “It’s a conversation,” says Grimes,
“and it’s a noble, sacred conversation.”
